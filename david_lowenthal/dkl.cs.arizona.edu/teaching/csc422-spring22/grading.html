<h4> Grading Scale and Policies </h4>
Grades will be assigned on the usual A-E basis. Grading will be absolute; 
there will be no "curve". Achieving a 90% will <i>guarantee </i>an "A", 80%
a "B", and so on. However, when the final grades are given, it could be the
case, for example, that an 85% gets an "A". Do not confuse this with a curve,
however. If everyone does A work (as I hope), everyone will get an A. If
everyone does C work, everyone will get a C. So that you know your grade
at all times, four fictitious students will be given grades for each assignment
and exam. These students will be named "Minimum A", "Minimum B", etc., indicating
the minimum score for each grade. 

<p>Grading will be divided as follows: </p>
   
<ul compact="COMPACT">
<li> Midterm and final exam: 50% (25% each)</li>
<li> Written assignments: 15%</li>
<li> Programming Assignments: 35%</li>
</ul>

<h4> Grading Timeliness </h4>

I take deadlines seriously and expect you to turn everything in on time.
In return, I will adhere to the following grading return policies.
<ul compact="COMPACT">
<li> All assignments will be returned within two weeks.</li>
<li> All exams will be returned within one week.</li>
<li> The grades will be kept up to date; you can find them on the 
<a href="https://d2l.arizona.edu/d2l/home/1119912" target="_blank"> CSc 422 Spring 2022 D2L site</a>.
</ul>

<h4> Regrades for Programming Assignments </h4>

If you lose points due to your program failing test cases, I will regrade using
the following policy.

<ul compact="COMPACT">
<li> You fix the code and resubmit it.</li>
<li> We re-execute your program on all the test cases, which yields a new grade.</li>
<li> We apply a penalty.  The <b>minimum</b> penalty is 10% per unique bug, 
but it can be more; the more significant the changes were to your code, the higher
the penalty.</li>
</ul>

<h4> Incompletes and Withdrawals </h4>
Requests for incomplete (I) or withdrawal (W) must be made in accordance with University policies, which are available  
<a href="http://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/grades-and-grading-system#incomplete" target="_blank">here</a> and 
<a href="http://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/grades-and-grading-system#Withdrawal" target="_blank">here</a>, respectively.


<h4> Important Note on Grading </h4>
Your grade will be the one you earn.  
 Under no circumstances will your graduation or visa status
affect your grade.  This includes situations such as: (1) your 
parents are coming for graduation, (2) your relatives are flying in from halfway
around the world for your graduation,&nbsp; (3) you have a job lined up and
have to start immediately, (4) you got all A's up to this point, and you
have never received a grade below an A, and/or (5) you will have to leave the
country if you do not achieve a certain grade.
