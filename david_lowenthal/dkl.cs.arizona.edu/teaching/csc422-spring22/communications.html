<h4> Course Communications </h4>
<p>
Class discussions and notes/clarifications from the TAs and me will go out via Piazza, so you are responsible for 
signing up for and checking there.
If you have something personal to ask/tell me, send it directly to me by email. 
I will be using D2L for keeping track of grades, posting video recordings, posting the syllabus, and
providing due dates on the D2L calendar.
