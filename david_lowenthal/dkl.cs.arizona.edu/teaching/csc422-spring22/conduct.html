<h4> Dept. of Computer Science Code of Conduct </h4>

The Department of Computer Science is committed to providing and maintaining a supportive educational environment for all.  We strive to be welcoming and inclusive, respect privacy and confidentiality, behave respectfully and courteously, and practice intellectual honesty.  Disruptive behaviors (such as physical or emotional harassment, dismissive attitudes, and abuse of department resources) will not be tolerated.  The complete Code of Conduct is available on our department web site.  We expect that you will adhere to this code, as well as the UA Student Code of Conduct, while you are a member of this class.

<p>
You can find the code of conduct <a href="https://www.cs.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/codeofconduct.pdf"> here </a>.


<h4> Classroom Behavior Policy </h4>

To foster a positive learning environment, students and instructors have a shared responsibility. We want a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment where all of us feel comfortable with each other and where we can challenge ourselves to succeed. To that end, our focus is on the tasks at hand and not on extraneous activities (e.g., texting, chatting, reading a newspaper, making phone calls, web surfing, etc.).

<p>
Students are asked to refrain from disruptive conversations with people sitting around them during lecture. Students observed engaging in disruptive activity will be asked to cease this behavior. Those who continue to disrupt the class will be asked to leave lecture or discussion and may be reported to the Dean of Students. 

<p>
Please refrain from using personal electronics, such as laptops and iPads, except for taking notes. 

<h4>Threatening Behavior Policy</h4>
The UA Threatening Behavior by Students Policy prohibits threats of physical harm to any member of the University community, including to oneself. See
