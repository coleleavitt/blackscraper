<h4> Code of Academic Integrity </h4>
Students are encouraged to share intellectual views and discuss freely the principles and applications of course materials. However, graded work/exercises must be the product of independent effort unless otherwise instructed. Students are expected to adhere to the UA Code of Academic Integrity as described in the UA General Catalog. See the policy
<a href="http://deanofstudents.arizona.edu/academic-integrity/students/academic-integrity" target="_blank">here</a>.

<!---
<p>Note that copying materials from the Web or past offerings of this or a similar course is a violation of academic honesty.
--->

<p>
Uploading material (including your assignments and programs) from this course to a website other than D2L (or the class piazza) is strictly prohibited and will be considered a violation of the course policy and a violation of the code of academic integrity. Obtaining material (again, including assignments and programs) associated with this course (or previous offerings of this course) on a site other than D2L (or the class piazza), such as Chegg, Course Hero, etc. or accessing these sites during a quiz or exam is a violation of the code of academic integrity. Any student determined to have uploaded or accessed material in an unauthorized manner will be reported to the Dean of Students for a Code of Academic Integrity violation, with a recommended sanction of a failing grade in the course.

<p>
If you violate the code of academic integrity in any other way (besides the instance listed above), 
the typical punishment will be a loss
of credit on the work submitted <b>and</b> a full letter grade reduction of the final grade.
