<h4> Reading Materials</h4>
   The required textbook for the course is <i>Foundations of Multithreaded,
Parallel, and Distributed Programming</i> by Andrews.
The book's <a href = "http://www2.cs.arizona.edu/people/greg/mpdbook/">
web site </a> has useful material.
You will be expected to read any assigned material; reading assignments will
be posted on the D2L calendar. 
We will not be able to cover all assigned reading in lecture. Please note,
however, that <b>you are responsible for any assigned material.</b>
Specifically, exam questions covering reading material are fair game.
