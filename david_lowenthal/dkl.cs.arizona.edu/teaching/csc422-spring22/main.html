<h4> CSc 422: Introduction to Parallel and Distributed Programming, Spring 2022 </h4>
<h4> Description of Course</h4>
Concepts and applications of parallel and distributed programs.  Process interaction using shared variables and message passing; parallel computing; development of correct programs; general problem solving techniques; scientific computing; distributed systems.  Programming assignments on multiple processor machines.
Topics include:
<ul compact="COMPACT">
   <li> Writing parallel programs</li>
    <li> Shared-memory synchronization mechanisms: critical sections, locks, semaphores, monitors, barriers</li>
    <li> Distributed-memory synchronization/communication mechanisms: message passing, rendezvous</li>
    <li> Shared- and distributed-memory programming paradigms</li>
    <li> Applications, such as peer-to-peer computing, map/reduce, data
         parallel computing, and languages and libraries for parallel
         computing.</li>

</ul>

<h4> Course Objectives</h4>
The course will cover how to write concurrent and parallel programs, how to ensure correct concurrent program behavior
through synchronization, and various parallel and distributed computing application areas.

<h4> Expected Learning Outcomes </h4>
At the end of the course, the student will master multithreaded, parallel, and
distributed programming and related concepts such as synchronization and communication.
