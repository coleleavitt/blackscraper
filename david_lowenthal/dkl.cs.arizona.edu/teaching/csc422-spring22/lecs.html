<h4> Lectures </h4>
 Attendance at lectures is optional. You are, however, responsible for all 
 material covered in lectures. We will sometimes 
be discussing material different 
 from the textbook. I will do my 
best to make lectures interesting. I believe that you won't just be   
able to read 
the notes and succeed.   
<p>You should come to lecture prepared. This means you have read the
assigned material in advance. 
</p>
   
<p>During lecture, please
do not hesitate to ask questions; you might
think your question is dumb, but more likely, many people are wondering about
the same thing.  

<p>
All lectures will be recorded and placed on D2L as soon as possible following each class.  
Please note that FERPA rules allow students watching the recording to see/hear other students in the class, so long
as I only post the recordings to D2L.
<b>
You may not modify content or re-use content for any
purpose other than personal educational reasons. You also may not share the content with anyone, including re-posting
the content anywhere.
All recordings are subject to government and
university regulation. Therefore, accessing unauthorized recordings or using them in a
manner inconsistent with UArizona values and educational policies are subject to suspension or
civil action.
