<h4> Malware </h4>

Do not turn in "malware" as a prank.  ("Malware" is software that intentionally does harm to a computer, computer data, computer networks, etc.)  Malware is a federal crime (see <a href="https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/97-1025.pdf">here</a> for more information). 
If you turn in malware, I will refer the situation to the proper law enforcement
authorities, as well as recommend a harsh punishment.
