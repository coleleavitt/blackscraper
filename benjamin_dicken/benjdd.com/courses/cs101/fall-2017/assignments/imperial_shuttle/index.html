  <h1 id="csc-101-imperial-shuttle">CSc 101: Imperial Shuttle</h1>

<p>This assignment should be written in the processing programming language.
You should only use processing features that we have discussed up to this point.
If you have questions about whether or not a particular feature can/should be used, ask the instructors!
You may use any processing version 3.0 or newer.</p>

<p>Your program file should have a header comment at the top that has the following format:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>//
// Author: Student Name
// Description:
//    A short description of what this program does!
// 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If any part of your scripts are particularly complex, comment it!</p>

<h2 id="drawing">Drawing</h2>

<p>In this assignment, you will write a processing program that generates a drawing of an imperial shuttle flying through space.
As you may already know, the imperial shuttle is an iconic spaceship from the original star-wars trilogy.
Below is a image.</p>

<p><img src="./res/imperial-shuttle.jpg" width="300" /></p>

<p>You will write a program in processing that draws a picture of this spaceship flying through space.
Your program should generate a window that looks very similar to below:</p>

<p><img src="./res/program-1-solution-screenshot.png" width="400" /></p>

<p>This rendered image must have the following characteristics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The canvas should be 600 pixels by 400 pixels</li>
  <li>A dark/black background</li>
  <li>A drawing of an imperial shuttle that closely resembles the one in the image on the left-hand side of the panel.
The pixels do not have to line up <em>exactly</em>, but it should be placed in a similar location and have a similar look.
You should use at least two triangles, one rectangle, three lines, and 5 dots.
All of the shapes, colored lights, etc should appear in the same place.
You may take “creative liberty” with the exact color and size of each part of the ship.</li>
  <li>An orange planet with a brown moon orbiting it on the right-hand side of the panel</li>
  <li>16 white stars, all of which should be visible (not behind any of the other drawings)
    <ul>
      <li>4 stars should be 5 pixels wide</li>
      <li>4 stars should be 4 pixels wide</li>
      <li>4 stars should be 3 pixels wide</li>
      <li>4 stars should be 2 pixels wide</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Ultimately, the image does not have to be pixel-for-pixel identical to the example.
You may take <em>some</em> creative liberty, but it must be similar and fulfill all of the above requirements.</p>

<p>You should name your code file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shuttle.pde</code>.</p>
