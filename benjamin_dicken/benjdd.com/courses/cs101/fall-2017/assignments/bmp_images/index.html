  <h1 id="csc-101-bmp-images">CSc 101: BMP Images</h1>

<p>In class, we discussed how computers represent information (files) on a computer, and we specifically taked about images.
We discussed many of the popular image formats at a high level.
We looked at the BMP format in-depth, and saw specific examples of how an image is “assembled” in bmp format.</p>

<p>In this assignment, you will be writing several bmp images by-hand, based on some non-bmp example images.</p>

<h2 id="3x3-minecraft-face-5-points">3x3 Minecraft Face (5 points)</h2>

<p><img src="./3x3-minecraft-1.png" width="200" /></p>

<p>Above is a png image of a (magnified) 3-pixel by 3-pixel minecraft face.
(For those of you who don’t know, <strong>Minecraft</strong> is a video-game, and the faces of the characters are typically 8x8 pixel images).
For this first problem, you’ll write a “mini” minecreaft face that is only 3x3 pixels.
You should write a 3x3 pixel bmp image that looks just like this one named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3x3-minecraft.bmp</code>.
You should “write” the image in a text editor like notepad (windows), TextEdit (mac), or atm (both).
Make sure you are editing in “plain text” mode.
You should not be saving this as a word document, or rich-text document.</p>

<h2 id="8x8-minecraft-face-10-points">8x8 Minecraft Face (10 points)</h2>

<p><img src="./8x8-minecraft-2.jpg" width="200" /></p>

<p>Above is a jpg image of a (magnified) 8-pixel by 8-pixel minecraft face.
This is the typical size of a face in minecraft.
You must write a BMP image that displays a minecraft face.
However, you should not choose the same one seen above!!!
Instead, go to <a href="https://mcskinsearch.com/">mcskinsearch.com</a> and find a face there.
This site can be used to browse all of the faces of every minecraft player (even yours, if you play).
You must choose a face that has at least 8 unique colors in it.
You should write an 8x8 pixel bmp image that looks just like this one named 
Name your image file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">username-minecraft.bmp</code>, where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">username</code> is the username of the face you are modeling yours after, found on the aforementioned website.</p>

<h2 id="initials-15-points">Initials (15 points)</h2>

<p><img src="./initials.png" width="300" /></p>

<p>Above is a jpg image of a (magnified) 14-pixel by 7-pixel image of my initials (BD).
You should write a picture by-hand that is at least 14x7 pixels with your first-name, last-name initials.
The background, first initial, and last initial should all be a different color.
You may choose any colors you like, so long as they are significantly different from each-other, so that the initials can actually be read!
Name this file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">initials.bmp</code>.</p>

<h2 id="hints-and-suggestions">Hints and Suggestions</h2>

<p>Use the class slides as a reference for how to assemble a bmp image.
If those are insufficient, Wikipedia has a great <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm_format">description and examples</a> of the Red-Green-Blue BMP format.
Feel free to use that as reference. 
Or, ask a question on Piazza and come to office hours!</p>

<p>To download each of the sample images from this assignment spec, right-click on the image and select “download” from the menu.</p>

<p>To figure out what each pixel color is for the first problem, use a color picker tool on your computer.
If you are on a Mac, you should use the <strong>Digital Color Meter</strong> application.
If you are on windows, try installing and using a tool like <a href="http://instant-eyedropper.com/">Instant Eyedropper</a>.</p>

<p>Make sure that you create a valid BMP image, which specifies the format, width/height, max color, as well as all of the actual color values for each pixel.</p>

<h2 id="editing-the-images">Editing the Images</h2>

<p>To create a custom BMP image file on a Mac, the steps are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Open up the program TextEdit</li>
  <li>Create a new file (“File” -&gt; “New”)</li>
  <li>Type the text of the image into the file</li>
  <li>Make sure you are in “plain-text” mode ( “Format” -&gt; “Make Plain Text” )</li>
  <li>Save the file, and make sure to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bmp</code> as the extension</li>
</ul>

<p>On Windows, the steps should be similar:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Open up the program NotePad</li>
  <li>Create a new file (“File” -&gt; “New”)</li>
  <li>Type the text of the image into the file
    <ul>
      <li>No need to change to “Plain Text Mode” with NotePad</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Save the file, and make sure to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bmp</code> as the extension</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="viewing-the-images">Viewing the Images</h2>

<p>If you have a Mac, you should be able to “view” a BMP image by just double-clicking it.
On windows, you might not have a program already installed to do so.
If not, you’ll need to download one.
My best recommendation is GIMP.
Just go to <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">www.gimp.org</a>, download, and install to use.</p>

<h2 id="submission-and-grading">Submission and Grading</h2>

<p>This was assigned on 9/1/2017.
It is due on 9/8/2017 at 5:00pm.</p>

<p>Turn in each of the files described in the spec (3 total) the assignment 2 dropbox in D2L before the due date.
Make sure to name the files <strong>exactly</strong> as this document specifies.
In general, make sure to follow these instructions precisely.
If you don’t, we will deduct points!!!</p>
