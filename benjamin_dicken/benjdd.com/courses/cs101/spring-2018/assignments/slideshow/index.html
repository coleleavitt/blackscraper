  <h1 id="csc-101-slideshow">CSc 101: Slideshow</h1>

<p>In this assignment, you’ll create a slide-show application based on a topic of your choosing.
One example of such a slide-show is shown below:</p>

<p><img src="./res/slideshow.gif" width="400" /></p>

<p>Notice a few things that you must conform to when you write your program:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The slide-show has a specific theme.
In this example, the theme is “the avengers” but you may choose whatever theme you like (must be PG-rated).</li>
  <li>There are four “slides” total.
You must have at least 4, but you may also create more.</li>
  <li>Each slide has a title (with large text), an image, and a short description (smaller text).</li>
  <li>You can also navigate left/right by using the ‘z’ and ‘m’ keys, respectively.</li>
  <li>There is no “wraparound” when browsing through slides.
You may only navigate forward/backward if there are more slides in that direction.</li>
  <li>The background of your entire canvas should also be an image that goes with the theme.</li>
  <li>The canvas should be 700x500</li>
  <li><strong>Extra Credit:</strong> You may navigate through the slides by clicking on the left and right arrow buttons on either edge of the screen.</li>
</ul>

<p>The only code you are allowed to put into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">draw()</code> are calls to functions that you have written.
You may not draw any shapes, respond to mouse clicks, have if-statements or for loops, etc. within <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">draw()</code>.
Instead, put your code into at least three separate, well-named functions.</p>

<h2 id="development-strategy">Development Strategy</h2>

<p>As with the last assignment, this one might seem complex.
If you break the problem down into smaller “chunks” it becomes much more manageable.
I recommend you use the following strategy to complete:</p>

<h3 id="1-choosing-a-theme">(1) Choosing a theme</h3>

<p>First, choose a theme that has at least 4 distinct sub-topics that you can create a slide about.
Then, choose your 5 images (1 for the background, and 4 for the slides) and put them in the same directory as your program.</p>

<h3 id="2-background-image">(2) Background Image</h3>

<p>Next, create your canvas and get the background image displayed and properly scaling across the screen.</p>

<p><img src="./res/slideshow-bg.png" width="250" /></p>

<h3 id="3-first-slide">(3) First Slide</h3>

<p>Next, get your first slide showing up.
Don’t worry about changing slides for now, just make sure that the image and text show up in the right location and with a reasonable size, like so:</p>

<p><img src="./res/slideshow-first.png" width="250" /></p>

<h3 id="4-slides-movement">(4) Slides Movement</h3>

<p>Now, use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">keyReleased()</code> function to handle the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'z'</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'m'</code> button clicks, to get the slides to change.</p>

<p><img src="./res/slideshow-nb.gif" width="250" /></p>

<p>But how should the movement work?
One possibility is to do the following.
In actuality, you should draw <em>all</em> of the slides, side-by-side.
For example:</p>

<p><img src="./res/slideshow-1.png" width="700" /></p>

<p>This will produce 2800x500 pixels worth of drawing.
However, your canvas will only display one of the slides at a time
When the user presses z/m or click the left/right buttons, you can move the entore drawing left or right 700 pixels (as long as there are more slides to show in the left or right direction).</p>

<h3 id="5-add-in-the-buttons-extra-credit">(5) Add in the buttons (Extra Credit)</h3>

<p>Lastly, add in the left/right buttons.
Make sure that the buttons are click-able to change the slide.
When the mouse is clicked outside of a button, nothing should happen.
If you are having trouble getting the buttons to work, try referring back to section 8.</p>

<h2 id="comments">Comments</h2>

<p>All of your programming should be well-formatted and easy for the graders to read and comprehend.
You should follow the style guidelines that we have discussed in class.
Each program file should have a header comment at the top that has roughly the following format:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>/*
 * Author: Student Name
 * Description:
 *    A short description of what this program does!
 */ 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If any part of your scripts are particularly complex, you should put documentation comments above those lines of code.
Name your program <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">netid_slideshow.pde</code> (where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">netid</code> is your UA username).</p>

<h2 id="submission-and-grading">Submission and grading</h2>

<p>This is due on 4/13/2018 at 5:00pm.
Turn it in to the D2L dropbox before the due date/time.</p>

<h3 id="you-must-turn-in-your-program-as-a-single-zip-file">You must turn in your program as a single zip file!</h3>

<p>Do not submit all of the files separately.
The stepts to turn in are as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Put your code (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">slideshow.pde</code>) and all image files into a directory named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">slideshow</code>.</li>
  <li>Make sure your program works from this directory.</li>
  <li>Zip up the entire <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">slideshow</code> directory into one zip file named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">slideshow.zip</code>.
    <ul>
      <li>(you might want to doubl-check all of the files zipped-up correctly by doing a test unzip, and looking at the site)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Turn in this zip file on D2L.</li>
</ol>
