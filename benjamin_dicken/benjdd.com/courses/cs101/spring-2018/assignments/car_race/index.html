  <h1 id="csc-101-car-race">CSc 101: Car Race</h1>

<p>In this assignment, you will write a processing program that generates an animation of two cars racing against each-other.</p>

<p>Below is a gif demonstrating what the animation should look like:</p>

<p><img src="./res/car_race.gif" width="500" /></p>

<p>This is a top-down view of two cars racing to a finish line on a race-track.
Notice a few things about this animation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The road background is made up of alternating dark/light gray lines spanning the whole screen.
These bars should be created using a for-loop, and slowly moved across the screen.</li>
  <li>The yellow lane-stripes are “painted” down the middle of the road.</li>
  <li>The red stripe is the finish line. 
It starts off-screen, but scrolls onto the screen a few seconds into the animation.</li>
  <li>The top lane has a green car (just drawn with two rectangles), and the bottom lane a blue car.
As you can see, the blue car is moving faster, and wins the race.</li>
  <li>The cars move up/down in their lanes to “follow” the mouse pointer.
You may use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mouseX</code> and/or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mouseY</code> variables to get this working correctly.
Each car should stay in it’s own lane.</li>
  <li>Once the finish-line goes off screen, the animation is “done”.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="programming-strategy">Programming Strategy</h2>

<p>As you can see, there are a lot of “moving parts” in this animation, which might make it seem hard.
Don’t be intimidated!
If you work on the animation one part at-a-time, it is easier to think about and write the code for.
I recommend that you work on this animation in several phases, rather than trying to do it all at once.</p>

<p>First, work on getting the road pattern drawn and animating correctly.
For example:</p>

<p><img src="./res/car_race_road.gif" width="400" /></p>

<p>The road pattern is really just alternating dark/light dray lines (or rectangles) that span the entire height of the canvas.
If you zoom way up on the road, the pattern is simply:</p>

<p><img src="./res/road_pattern.png" width="200" /></p>

<p>You should use a for-loop to repeat this pattern on the road.
Once this is working, then add in the road stripes:</p>

<p><img src="./res/car_race_stripe.gif" width="400" /></p>

<p>Then, add the cars in, without worrying about tracking the mouse positions:</p>

<p><img src="./res/car_race_two_cars.gif" width="400" /></p>

<p>The last step should be making the cars follow the mouse position.</p>

<p><strong>You must use the setup and draw functions, like we discussed in class.</strong>
<strong>Also, start early!</strong>
This assignment shouldn’t be super “hard”, but it will probably take much trial-and-error get the various patterns animating properly.
You should start at least a few days before the deadline, ask questions, visit office hours, etc.</p>

<p>Name the program <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">car_race.pde</code>.</p>

<h2 id="matching-colors-and-shapes">Matching Colors and Shapes</h2>

<p>You should do your best to match the colors and sizes of the road and lane stripes, but they don’t need to be “pixel-for-pixel” perfect.
You are welcome to customize the color and look/style of the finish line and the race-cars.
However, the bottom car should be the one that wins.</p>

<p>The canvas should be between 600 and 800 pixels wide, and between 400 and 500 pixels tall.</p>

<h2 id="comments">Comments</h2>

<p>All of your programming should be well-formatted and easy for the graders to read and comprehend.
You should follow the style guidelines that we have discussed in class.
Each program file should have a header comment at the top that has roughly the following format:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>//
// Author: Student Name
// Description:
//    A short description of what this program does!
// 
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="submission-and-grading">Submission and grading</h2>

<p>This assignment is due on 2/16/2018 at 5:00pm.</p>

<p>Turn in each of the files described in the spec (just 1) the assignment 5 drop-box in D2L before the due date.
Make sure to name the files <strong>exactly</strong> as this document specifies.</p>
