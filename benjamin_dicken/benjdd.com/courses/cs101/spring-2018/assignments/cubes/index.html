  <h1 id="csc-101-cubes">CSc 101: Cubes</h1>

<p>In this assignment, you will write a simple “game” that allows a user to move a character (a circle) around the screen.
An example of the game being played is shown below:</p>

<p><img src="./res/cubes.gif" width="300px" /></p>

<p>Note several things about this game:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The canvas is 500x500px.
Each Square on the grid is 100x100 pixels.</li>
  <li>The background can be a color of your choosing (in my example, I chose blue).</li>
  <li>Your character should start in the top-left position.
The character must be a circle, but you can add extra shapes if you like.</li>
  <li>The character can move up/left/down/right with the w/a/s/d keys, respectively.</li>
  <li>The starting tile should be red.</li>
  <li>There are two yellow tiles.
The player should not be able to move onto a yellow tile, even if they try.</li>
  <li>When the player lands on the green circle, the “You Win!” text should appear on the screen in large letters.</li>
  <li>The player should be forced to stay in-bounds on the grid of tiles.</li>
</ul>

<p>The red, yellow, and green tiles should have the colors shown.
You may choose any color you want for the player, borders, and background.</p>

<p>Also, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use for-loops to generate th grid of tiles.</li>
  <li>Use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">keyPressed</code> function to detect key presses.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="development-strategy">Development Strategy</h2>

<p>Below is a suggestion of how to go about implementing this program.
You are not required to follow it though.
First, use for-loops to get the basic grid displaying.</p>

<p><img src="./res/cubes-blue.png" width="275px" /></p>

<p>Next, draw the red, yellow, and green tiles.
You don’t have to worry about enforcing the rules with the yellow or green tiles yet, just get them drawn.</p>

<p><img src="./res/cubes-color.png" width="275px" /></p>

<p>Next, draw the player so that it begins on the top-left tile.</p>

<p><img src="./res/cubes-player.png" width="275px" /></p>

<p>Next, get the player movement working, and make sure that you can properly detect that the player has won.
You’ll need to use if-statements for both of these tasks.
Don’t yet worry about blocking the yellow tiles or the borders.</p>

<p><img src="./res/cubes-win.gif" width="275px" /></p>

<p>Lastly, add some extra if-statements (or change ones you already wrote) so that the player stays on the canvas, and cannot go over a yellow tile.</p>

<h2 id="comments">Comments</h2>

<p>All of your programming should be well-formatted and easy for the graders to read and comprehend.
You should follow the style guidelines that we have discussed in class.
Each program file should have a header comment at the top that has roughly the following format:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>//
// Author: Student Name
// Description:
//    A short description of what this program does!
// 
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="submission-and-grading">Submission and grading</h2>

<p>It is due on 3/16/2018 at 5:00pm.</p>

<p>Name the file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cubes.pde</code>.
Turn in each of the files described in the spec (1 total) the assignment dropbox in D2L before the due date.
Make sure to name the files <strong>exactly</strong> as this document specifies.
In general, make sure to follow these instructions precisely.</p>
