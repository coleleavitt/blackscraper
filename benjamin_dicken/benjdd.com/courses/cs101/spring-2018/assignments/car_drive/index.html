  <h1 id="csc-101-car-drive">CSc 101: Car Drive</h1>

<p>In this assignment, you will write a processing program that generates a very simple animation of a car driving.
Below is an example of what the finished product should resemble:</p>

<p><img src="./res/car_drive.gif" width="400" /></p>

<p>Notice several things about this animation, which you should mimic:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There are several items on the screen that do not move.
The sky, the ground, the road, and the car.</li>
  <li>There is one tree that moves across the screen, and 5 birds.
Even though the car is not moving, when the other shapes move, it (sorta) makes it look like the car is actually progressing forwards.</li>
  <li>The tree and birds begin off-screen, and move across once from left-to-right.</li>
  <li>The birds move at a slightly faster rate than the tree does.</li>
  <li>The tree and birds only need to “cross the screen” once.</li>
</ul>

<p>You should use lines or custom shapes for the birds.
The car must have at least a body, wheels, tires, and a window.
If you want, you can make the car, birds, or tree much more detailed and intricate.</p>

<p>Name your file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">car_drive.pde</code>.</p>

<h2 id="programming-strategy">Programming strategy</h2>

<p>You should start by just getting the static (non-moving) parts of the drawing on the screen (The sky, earth, road, and car).
Once you have this, work on the tree movement first.
The tree might be a little easier, since you don’t need to repeat anything.</p>

<p>Lastly, do the birds.
There must be 5 birds, and they must be “repeated” using a for-loop.</p>

<h2 id="comments">Comments</h2>

<p>All of your programming should be well-formatted and easy for the graders to read and comprehend.
You should follow the style guidelines that we have discussed in class.
Each program file should have a header comment at the top that has roughly the following format:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>//
// Author: Student Name
// Description:
//    A short description of what this program does!
// 
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="submission-and-grading">Submission and grading</h2>

<p>It is due on 2/9/2018 at 5:00pm.</p>

<p>Turn in each of the files described in the spec (1 total) the assignment 4 dropbox in D2L before the due date.
Make sure to name the files <strong>exactly</strong> as this document specifies.
In general, make sure to follow these instructions precisely.</p>
