  <h1 id="csc-101-random-sound-board">CSc 101: Random Sound Board</h1>

<p>In this (extra-credit) assignment, you’ll be implementing a sound-board application that incorporates randomness.
You will need to both play sounds and display images.
Below is a video-recording showing the behavior of a solution to this assignment:</p>

<video controls="controls" width="800" height="350" name="sound board" src="./res/random.mov"></video>

<p>The high-level requirements for this program are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There should be a title at the top of the canvas.</li>
  <li>You should use an image for the background.
You can use the same image that I did (linked later on in this spec) or choose one of your own.</li>
  <li>Below the title will be the sound-board.
The sound board will consist of 3 total buttons.
Each button should have an image related to the category of the sound.
When each button is pressed a <em>random</em> sound in that sound category should be played.
When pressed, each button should play one of three random sounds.</li>
  <li>You must have 3 different sound-buttons.</li>
  <li>Sound should be able to play “on-top” of each-other.
If you click on a button, then immediately click on another, both can be playing at the same time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each button should represent a particular theme.
For the example, I chose Indiana Jones, Star Wars, and Star Trek.
You can re-use these themes if you want, or you can choose your own.
The images on each button should properly represent the theme.</p>

<p>You should find three sound files for each theme.
When a particular button is pressed, the program should randomly choose one of the three sound files to play, and then play it.
You should use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">random()</code> function to help with this!</p>

<p>You can choose whatever theme that you want for this assignment (it doesn’t have to be movie-themed like the example).
To find sounds for the theme of your choice, just Google for sound files.
You can also use <a href="https://freesound.org/">https://freesound.org/</a>.</p>

<h2 id="files">Files</h2>

<p>If you choose to create a program with the same theme as mine, that is OK.
If so, I am providing all of the images and sound files.
The sound files beginning with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ij</code> are for Indiana Jones, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sw</code> ones are for Star Wars, and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">st</code> ones are for Star Trek.
Click on the links to the files to access and then download them to your computers.
Remember: the sound files go in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data</code> directory.</p>

<h2 id="development-strategy">Development Strategy</h2>

<p>If you break the problem down into smaller “chunks” it becomes much more manageable to tackle.
I recommend you use the following strategy to complete:</p>

<h3 id="1-choose-and-display-a-background">(1) Choose and display a background</h3>

<p>Select a good background image and then set it as the background of your canvas.
Make sure the image size fits will with the canvas size.</p>

<p><img src="./res/1.png" height="220" /></p>

<h3 id="2-display-a-title">(2) Display a title</h3>

<p>Choose a appropriate title for your program, and display it at the top.
Make sure you choose a font color that doesn’t blend in with the background image too much.</p>

<p><img src="./res/2.png" height="220" /></p>

<h3 id="3-display-the-image-buttons">(3) Display the image buttons</h3>

<p>Next, place all of the image buttons on the canvas, like you see pictured.
Don’t worry about playing the sounds for now.</p>

<p><img src="./res/3.png" height="220" /></p>

<h3 id="4-playing-non-random-sounds">(4) Playing Non-random Sounds</h3>

<p>Now, add in the logic to play a sound with each image click.
In this step, don’t worry about choosing a random sound.
Instead, just play one particular sound for each button.
Get your program so that each button press plays a unique sound, but not a randomly-chosen one.
We have done button-pressing in several of the past sections and assignments, so refer to those if you can’t remember how to set-up a button!</p>

<h3 id="5-playing-random-sounds">(5) Playing Random Sounds</h3>

<p>Now, add in the randomness!
When each button is pressed, you should have it randomly choose between the three sounds and play one of them.
You should use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">random()</code> function for this.
You can generate a random integer between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3</code>.
Once you have this number, use it to select/load one of the sounds and then play it!</p>

<h2 id="comments">Comments</h2>

<p>All of your programming should be well-formatted and easy for the graders to read and comprehend.
You should follow the style guidelines that we have discussed in class.
Each program file should have a header comment at the top that has roughly the following format:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>/*
 * Author: Student Name
 * Description:
 *    A short description of what this program does!
 */ 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Each function should have a descriptive block-comment above it, and other helpful comments.
If any part of your scripts are particularly complex, you should put documentation comments above those lines of code.
Name your program <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">random_sound_board.pde</code>.</p>
