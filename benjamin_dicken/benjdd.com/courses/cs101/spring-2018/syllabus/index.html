<h2 id="university-of-arizona">University of Arizona</h2>
<h2 id="spring-2018-syllabus">Spring 2018 Syllabus</h2>

<h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>

<p>This course introduces students to some of the big ideas in computer science.
It is intended for students who have no prior programming experience.
It will excite students about the application of computer science to various disciplines, and show the social impact possible through the use of technology in developing regions, politics, medicine, and other fields.
Several core concepts in computer science will be presented, including logic, problem-solving techniques, data representation, computer hardware, and hardware-software interaction.
Students will leave this course with basic programming and problem-solving skills, increased technical literacy, and a greater ability to recognize problems that can be solved with technology.</p>

<h2 id="class-web-page-and-d2l">Class Web Page and D2L</h2>

<p>The main course website (benjdd.com/courses/cs101/spring-2018/) will host the majority of the content, including the syllabus, slides, lecture notes, and assignments.
We will only use D2L for submitting assignments and posting grades.
We will also use piazza for questions and discussion.</p>

<h2 id="piazza">Piazza</h2>

<p>We will use Piazza as the primary platform for announcements, discussion, and Q&amp;A.
You should not email the instructor or section-leaders directly.
If you have a general question, post it publicly.
If you have a private question, or would like to include your work or solutions to a problem or assignment, post a private question to only the instructors.
Never include your code or solutions in a public post.</p>

<h2 id="coursework-and-grading-policies">Coursework and Grading Policies</h2>

<p>The points for this course are distributed as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>12% Final Exam</li>
  <li>30% Exams (3 exams at 10% each)</li>
  <li>48% Homework assignments (3-4% per assignment)</li>
  <li>10% Graded group quizzes</li>
</ul>

<p>Final grades will be assigned by summing up the points earned from the exams, assignments, and group quizzes.
The final grade will be chosen based on the following rubric:</p>

<ul>
  <li>90% or above is an A</li>
  <li>&lt; 90% and &gt;= 80% is a B</li>
  <li>&lt; 80% and &gt;= 70% is a C</li>
  <li>&lt; 70% and &gt;= 60% is a D</li>
  <li>Less than 60% is an E</li>
</ul>

<p>University policy regarding grades and grading systems is available at http://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/grades-and-grading-system</p>

<p>The Department of Computer Science Grading Policy is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Instructors will explicitly promise when every assignment and exam will be graded and returned to students.
These promised dates will appear in the syllabus, associated with the corresponding due dates and exam dates.</li>
  <li>Graded homework will be returned before the next homework is due.</li>
  <li>Exams will be returned “promptly”, as defined by the instructor (and as promised in the syllabus).</li>
  <li>Grading delays beyond promised return-by dates will be announced as soon as possible with an explanation for the delay.</li>
</ul>

<p>The exams will cover material discussed in-class, in the readings, and in assignments.
They will also draw from concepts that the students learn when doing the homework assignments and may include any material covered up to the point of the exam.
They will be graded within one week of being given.</p>

<p>There will be 13-15 homework assignments.
The majority of these will be programming assignments.
These assignments will be graded based on both program correctness (passing all of the test cases) and code formatting style (properly indenting code, good commenting, and following naming/style conventions).
A few of the assignments may be written homeworks.
In the written homeworks, students will solve logic problems, develop simple algorithms, write short-answer responses, etc.
These will be graded within one week after the last valid submission date by the instructors and teaching assistants.</p>

<p>Homework assignments are due at the date/time specified on each assignment.
Each student will be allowed 3 late days over the course of the semester.
If a student chooses to use a late day, they may submit a homework one day (24 hours) late without penalty.
Only one late day may be used per assignment.
Once all late days have been used, a late homework submission will result in a grade of zero.</p>

<p>There will be 14 group quizzes throughout the semester.
These will not be announced ahead-of-time, and they can not be made up under any circumstance.
However, the lowest 4 grades will be dropped.
The remaining 10 will count towards your grade at 1% each.
When given, these will generally be on concepts covered within the past 2-3 class periods.
Students must work in groups of two, and may talk amongst themselves.
Section leaders will also be available to provide clarification and guidance.
These will generally take ~10 minutes of class-time.</p>

<p>There are no scheduled extra credit opportunities, but they may be assigned by the discretion of the instructor.</p>

<p>Exams and group quizzes must be taken during the assigned class period.
They may not be made up, except in the case of an emergency situation.
If an emergency arises and a student is unable to take an exam or quiz because of it, students must provide documentation showing why they were unable to attend the exam or quiz.</p>

<h2 id="final-exam">Final Exam</h2>
<p>The final exam will be on May 10th (Thursday) from 10:30am-12:30pm.
Do not make travel plans that conflict with this date!</p>

<h2 id="class-format">Class Format</h2>
<p>This class is being taught in a collaborative learning space (CLS).
The room is structured in such a way as to promote collaborative learning and group-work.
There will be a number of in-class group activities mixed in with lecture.</p>

<h2 id="attendance">Attendance</h2>

<p>Attendance at lecture is not recorded, but you should still come.
Attendance at section is required and recorded.</p>

<h2 id="computer-labs">Computer Labs</h2>
<p>As a CS student, you have access to the computers in Gould-Simpson room 228.

You may use these machines for course-work.</p>

<h2 id="section">Section</h2>
<p>In addition to attending lecture 3 times per-week, you are required to attend a once-per-week section.
In section, you will work on problems, review concepts.
Your section leader will sometimes introduce new concepts as well.
Attendance at section is recorded by both a sign-in sheet and you submitting the work you have done.
You must do both, and solve a sufficient number of problems to get the points for attendance.
You have 2 “free” section skips.
After that, each section you skip will result in a 3% deduction from your final grade in the course.</p>

<h2 id="test-makeup">Test Makeup</h2>
<p>If you miss an exam due to a medical or other emergency, you may be asked to provide documentation before being allowed to make-up the points.
You also must let the instructor know you will miss the exam with 48-hours notice before the exam, if possible.</p>

<h2 id="course-communications">Course Communications</h2>
<p>Course communication and announcements will be made either in-class, on D2L, the class webpage, or on the course Piazza page.</p>
