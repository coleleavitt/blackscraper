  <h1 id="csc-250-assignment-0">CSc 250: Assignment 0</h1>

<p>This assignment has zero programming or “computer science”.
Since we have not learned much about computer science yet, there isn’t any programming I can assign!
Instead, this assignment will entail answering some simple questions about yourself and submitting/discussing them with me.
The goal of the assignment is for me to have the opportunity to get to know each of you.</p>

<p>Here we go:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>What’s your name?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where are you from?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Year in college?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Major(s) / Minor(s) ?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why did you choose the Major(s) / Minor(s) that you did?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Favorite course or teacher?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do you have any previous programming background? If so, what specifically?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why are you taking this course?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How do you hope to apply what you learn in this course to your field of study?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What do you hope to get out of this course?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any interesting hobbies?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tell me some thing(s) interesting/unique about yourself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is something interesting you learned recently?</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="submission-and-grading">Submission and Grading</h2>

<p>To fulfil the requirements of this assignment, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Copy all of the questions above (exactly as they appear, numbers and all) into a file named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">assignment-0.txt</code>. Naming the file correctly is very important. Pay attention to the file name!</li>
  <li>Fill in your personalized answers to each question below the question.</li>
  <li>Turn in the file on D2L in the “assignment 0” submission folder</li>
  <li>Print out a hard-copy of the file and bring <em>** in person **</em> to my office while I’m there.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you cannot make it to any of my office hours, email me to set up an alternate meeting time. Don’t wait until the day before it is due to email me. Get in touch early.</p>

<p>50% of the grade comes from filling out the answers to the questions, and submitting the answers file to d2l. The other 50% comes from seeing me in my office!</p>

<p>This was assigned on Thursday, January 12, 2017. It is due Thursday, January 19, 2017, at noon.</p>
