  <h1 id="csc-250-assignment-7">CSc 250: Assignment 7</h1>

<p>This assignment is primarily python.
You should only use python features that we have discussed up to this point.
If you have questions about whether or not a particular feature can/should be used, ask the instructors!</p>

<p>When grading your assignments, each problem/script/function will be thoroughly tested with many types of input, so make sure you test your scripts/functions well!</p>

<p>The python in this assignment will be graded using python 3.6, and tests will be run on a Mac machine.
In general python works well cross-platform, but if you want to be absolutely sure your program works as expected, test on a mac!
Any python version 3.4 or newer should suffice though.</p>

<p>All of your scripts should be well-formatted and easy for the graders to read.
Each script should have a header comment at the top that has the following format:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>#
# Author: Student Name
# Description:
#    A short description of what this program / script / set of functions does!
# 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Each function in your script(s) should have a descriptive comment above it.
If any part of your scripts are particularly complex, you should put documentation comments above those lines of code.</p>

<h2 id="problem-1---puter-part-2-100-points">Problem 1 - ‘Puter Part 2 (100 Points)</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/puter-2.jpg" width="300" /></p>

<p>This problem is new version of assignment 5, where we implemented a very simple version of the puter AI.
In this assignment we will re-implement puter, but it will have some more interesting and advanced features.</p>

<p>Similar to the previous puter, we are not going to interact with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">puter</code> with our voices.
Puter will accept questions and inquiries from standard input on the command-line, and print out it’s answers to the command line as well.</p>

<p>To start up puter, you will run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python3.X puter-2.py</code> on the command line.
When you run this you’ll see:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ python3 puter-2.py
PUTER: Hello and welcome! Let's talk...

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>From this point, the user (you) can type a question, and then hit “Enter” to have puter process the question and provide an answer.
As you read through the rest of the problem specification, notice that all lines that puter outputs are started with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PUTER: </code> (or a different name, perhaps?).
Lines that the user types/inputs do not start with any prefix.</p>

<h3 id="no-question-limit">No question limit</h3>

<p>For this version of puter, there is no longer a 10-question limit.</p>

<h3 id="manual-exit">Manual Exit</h3>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exit</code> keyword should work similarly to the last assignment.
You will have to make a change to save information to a file though.
More on that later.</p>

<h3 id="questions-from-puter-1">Questions from Puter-1</h3>

<p>This version of puter should handle the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">how are you?</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">how goes it?</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">what time is it?</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">what is the date?</code> questions in the same way that the first version of puter did.
You should not support <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">what is your favorite color?</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">what is your birthday?</code>.</p>

<h3 id="unknown">Unknown</h3>

<p>When this version of puter encounters a question or statement that it does not support, it should respond in a similar way that the previous version did.
The response should be:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ python3 puter-2.py
PUTER: Hello and welcome! Let's talk...
why so serious?
PUTER: Huh?
can I have some candy?
PUTER: Huh?
why are you so dumb?
PUTER: Huh?
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="personal-information">Personal information</h3>

<p>This version of puter will have the ability to “remember” various bits of personal information that you tell it.
Thus, this version of puter will both respond to questions (ending in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">?</code>) and reason about statements (ending with no specific punctuation).</p>

<p>Puter will accept statements of the form <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">my favorite A is B</code>, where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code> is a string and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">B</code> is also a string.
Puter will remember that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">B</code> is your favorite <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code>.
Later, if you ask <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">what is my favorite A?</code>, puter will respond with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">B</code>.</p>

<p>Below are a few examples:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ python3 puter-2.py
PUTER: Hello and welcome! Let's talk...
I do not know how to speak Chinese
PUTER: Huh?
my favorite food is orange chicken
PUTER: OK, got it.
my favorite car is a 72 corvette
PUTER: OK, got it.
what is my favorite food?
PUTER: Your favorite food is orange chicken.
what is my favorite car?
PUTER: Your favorite car is a 72 corvette.
what is the best food?
PUTER: Huh?
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice the pattern: Statements that include new personal information for puter to remember start with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">my favorite </code>, and should always contain ` is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.
Everything between </code>my favorite ` and ` is ` is what the user can later ask about.
Everything between ` is ` and the end of the string is the “answer”.</p>

<p>If the user asks for a “favorite” that has not yet been specified, puter should reply with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Not sure :-(</code>.</p>

<h2 id="saving-and-loading-personal-info">Saving and Loading Personal Info</h2>

<p>Personal information specified in a puter session should be saved to a file, and remembered for the next session.
All of the info should be saved to a file named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">favorites.txt</code> in the same directory as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">puter-2.py</code>.
When a session is closed with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exit</code>, puter will save all favoties.
A good technique for saving info like this to a file is given in the <a href="./lectures/python-file-io.html">lecture notes on file io</a>.</p>

<p>Below is an example demonstrating this feature:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ cat favorites.txt
$
$ python3 puter-2.py
PUTER: Hello and welcome! Let's talk...
what is my favorite drink?
PUTER: Not sure :-(
my favorite drink is coffee
PUTER: OK, got it.
what is my favorite drink?
PUTER: Your favorite drink is coffee.
exit
PUTER: Personal info saved!
PUTER: Bye!
$
$
$ python3 puter-2.py
PUTER: Hello and welcome! Let's talk...
what is my favorite drink?
PUTER: Your favorite drink is coffee.
exit
PUTER: Personal info saved!
PUTER: Bye!
$
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When a new puter session is started, it should load all information from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">favorites.txt</code>.</p>

<h2 id="name-change">Name change</h2>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PUTER</code> is the default name for this AI.
However, in this version, we will be able to <em>change</em> puter’s name within a single session.</p>

<p>To do this, issue the statement:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>rename yourself to X.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice that the command starts with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rename yourself to </code>.
The name itself what lies between these two strings.
The AI’s name is a case-sensitive value.
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PUTER</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Puter</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">puter</code> are treated as three distinct names.</p>

<p>Here are a few interactive examples of changing the name:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ python3 puter-2.py
PUTER: Hello and welcome! Let's talk...
rename yourself to Batman
Batman: OK, name changed!
hi batman
Batman: Huh?
rename yourself to Dwight Schrute
Dwight Schrute: OK, name changed!
how are you dwight?
Dwight Schrute: Huh?
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The name does <em>not</em> need to be saved from session-to-session.</p>

<h3 id="other-notes">Other Notes</h3>

<p>Notice that puter no longer says <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PUTER: Go ahead, ask me something:</code> in between each statement.
This applies for all questions/statements/features in this assignment.</p>

<h3 id="example-sessions">Example Sessions</h3>

<p>Below are a few example sessions (or in some cases, sequences of sessions).
Your program should behave identically to these scenarios:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ cat favorites.txt
$
$ python3 puter-2.py
PUTER: Hello and welcome! Let's talk...

<h2 id="testing-for-correctness">Testing for correctness</h2>

<p>This assignment requires printing out precise text messages and notifications.
As already mentioned, it is important to be precise when doing these printouts.</p>

<p>We will only take minimal points off for very minor differences (for example, minor character spacing issues).
However, we will take points off for any non-trivial differences, so try to be as precise as you can!</p>

<h2 id="submission-and-grading">Submission and grading</h2>

<p>This problem will be graded out of 100 points.</p>

<p>This was assigned on Friday, March 3, 2017.
It is due Friday, March 10, 2017, at 6:00pm (right before spring break).</p>

<p>Turn-in instructions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Place the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.py</code> file in a directory named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">netid-assignment-7</code> where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">netid</code> is <em>your</em> netid. Make sure only the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.py</code> file(s) exist in this directory, no others.</li>
  <li>Create a zip file from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">netid-assignment-7</code> directory. The result should be named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">netid-assignment-7.zip</code>.
There are instructions online for how to <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/PH22194?locale=en_US">do this with a Mac</a> and how to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14200/windows-compress-uncompress-zip-files">do this with a PC</a>.
Make sure to zip the directory, not the file(s) individually!</li>
  <li>Submit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">netid-assignment-7.zip</code> to the assignment-7 D2L dropbox.</li>
</ul>

<p>Following these turn-in instructions closely is very important, because our grading scripts will depend on some of the details.
You may lose points if these instructions are not followed precisely!</p>
