  <h1 id="csc-110-contacts">CSc 110: Contacts</h1>

<p>This assignment should be written in the python programming language.
You should only use python features that we have discussed up to this point.
If you have questions about whether or not a particular feature can/should be used, ask the instructors!
You may use any python version 3.0 or newer.</p>

<p>All of your programming should be well-formatted and easy for the graders to read and comprehend.
Each program file should have a header comment at the top that has the following format:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>#
# Author: Student Name
# Description:
#    A short description of what this program does!
# 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If any part of your scripts are particularly complex, you should put documentation comments above those lines of code.</p>

<h2 id="contact-manager">Contact Manager</h2>

<p>Almost everyone these days has some type of contact list for managing the phone numbers and email addresses of friends, co-workers, and acquaintances.
Some use Google contacts( <a href="http://www.contacts.google.com">contacts.google.com</a> ), others use the contacts app on their phone, and some still even prefer old-fashioned paper-and-pencil organization.</p>

<p>In this assignment, you will implement a very simple contact organizer application in python.</p>

<p>You will write a program called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">contacts.py</code>.
Using this application, you will be able to request contact information, as well as add new contacts to your list.</p>

<p>This program will read and write contacts to/from a file named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">contacts.txt</code>.
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">contacts.txt</code> will have a file format that looks like the following:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Bill Jones | bjon@gmail.com | 520-999-8765
Sam Dekker | dekker@apple.com | 123-456-7890
Janet Keller | kel@yahoo.com | 456-2356
James Jamie | jjamie@gmail.com | 435-234-2334
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The precise names, emails, and phone numbers may vary.
Also, the number of contacts in the file may vary.
You should not assume that the file has any particular number of contacts in it.
It could even be totally empty.
You can assume that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">contacts.txt</code> file is in the same directory as the program you are implementing (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">contacts.py</code>).</p>

<p>When <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">contacts.py</code> begins, it should read in and save all of the contact names, emails, and phone numbers into the program.
Since you wonâ€™t know how many contacts are in the file ahead-of-time, you should use lists to accomplish store the information in.
As you read in each contact, you can append the info into lists.</p>

<p>Once read them all in, your program should <em>repeatedly</em> prompt the user to enter in commands.
Your program should support three main types of commands.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="1-show-me-contact-x">(1) show me contact X</h3>

<p>The user can enter a command of the form <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">show me contact X</code>.
In this case, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X</code> is the full name of a person (meaning that, it can have spaces in it).
If the command that a user types begins with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">show me contact</code>, then you should check to see if the name <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X</code> is in the contact list.
If it is, you should report the contact info like so:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>X's contact info:
  email: A
  phone: B
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, you should replace X, A, and B with the actual name, email, and phone number.
If the name does not exist, then you should print:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Not sure who that is.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Either way, after processing the command, the program should prompt the user for the next command afterward.</p>

<h3 id="2-add-contact">(2) add contact</h3>

<p>When <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">add contact</code> is typed, the program will continue to prompt the user for three additional values: The name, email, and number of the contact.
Once it prompts the user for these three things, the program will <em>add</em> this new contact to the list(s) of contact info that are stored in the program.
Below is an example of what this should look like:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; add contact
    name: X
    email: Y
    phone: Z
contact added!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is what it would look like, but the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Y</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Z</code> values will be custom values entered by the user.
Each time an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">add contact</code> command is processed, a new contact should be added to the list.
You do not need to validate that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Y</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Z</code> are any particular type of input.</p>

<h3 id="3-exit">(3) exit</h3>

<p>If the user types <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exit</code> (all lower case) then the program should print an exit message and end.
For example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; exit
Goodbye!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When you exit the program, you should make sure to <em>save</em> the contents of the contact info lists back into the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">contacts.txt</code> file.
This is important so that your program will remember all of the newly-added contacts when it runs again in the future.</p>

<p>If contacts were added via the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">add contact</code> command, these must be saved into the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">contacts.txt</code> file, using the format described earlier.</p>

<h3 id="other">Other</h3>

<p>If any other command is entered, your program should print <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Huh?</code> and then prompt the user for another command.</p>

<hr />

<p>I will be providing a lot of example runs/output on the diff-testing tool on the class website.
You should take care to make sure that the output of your program very closely matches the example runs that I post.
That will be the best way to make sure you are implementing the program correctly.</p>

<h3 id="diff-testing">Diff-Testing</h3>

<p>As I mentioned, I will be providing many test-cases on the diff-testing tool on the class website.
The format of the test cases that I will put on there is a little bit different than usual.
The text of each test will have 3 parts.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first part will be the program printing/output that you should match identically.</li>
  <li>The second part will be what the contents of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">contacts.txt</code> should be from the get-go (before you run the program).</li>
  <li>The third part will be what the contents of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">contacts.txt</code> should be <em>after</em> running the test.
This is necessary because running your program may change the contents.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is critical that you test this program very well.</p>

<h2 id="submission-and-grading">Submission and grading</h2>

<p>It is due on 7/17/2017 at 7:00pm.</p>

<p>You should put all of your code in to a python file named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">contacts.py</code>.
Submit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">contacts.py</code> to the associated D2L dropbox.
Following these turn-in and naming instructions closely is very important, because our grading scripts will depend on some of the details.
You may lose points if these instructions are not followed precisely!</p>
