  <h1 id="csc-110-rocket-ship">CSc 110: Rocket Ship</h1>

<h2 id="rocket-ship">Rocket Ship</h2>

<p>You are to write a program that produces a specific text figure that is supposed to look like a rocket ship.
You must name your code file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rocketship.py</code>.
You should exactly reproduce the format of the output described in the specification below.
This includes having identical characters and spacing.
You can use the diff testing tool on the class website to check that you program is generating the correct output.</p>

<p>Initially, your program will read in a single input from the python shell.
The prompt for the value should look like so:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Enter rocket size: X
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The user of the program may enter any value for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X</code> greater than or equal to 2.</p>

<p>Using this value, your program will print out a rocket with corresponding width, height, and patterns.
Below is an example of what the program will print when a size of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2</code> is entered:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>   /**\
  //**\\
 ///**\\\
*========*
|./\../\.|
|/\/\/\/\|
|\/\/\/\/|
|.\/..\/.|
*========*
|\/\/\/\/|
|.\/..\/.|
|./\../\.|
|/\/\/\/\|
*========*
   /**\
  //**\\
 ///**\\\
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When size 3 is entered instead, notice how the rocket grows:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>     /**\
    //**\\
   ///**\\\
  ////**\\\\
 /////**\\\\\
*============*
|../\..../\..|
|./\/\../\/\.|
|/\/\/\/\/\/\|
|\/\/\/\/\/\/|
|.\/\/..\/\/.|
|..\/....\/..|
*============*
|\/\/\/\/\/\/|
|.\/\/..\/\/.|
|..\/....\/..|
|../\..../\..|
|./\/\../\/\.|
|/\/\/\/\/\/\|
*============*
     /**\
    //**\\
   ///**\\\
  ////**\\\\
 /////**\\\\\
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can see examples of sizes 2-6 on the diff-tester website.
Your program should support all of these sizes.</p>

<p>One way to write a Python program to draw this figure would be to write a single print statement that prints each line of the figure.
However, this solution would not receive full credit.
A major part of this assignment is showing that you understand while loops.
In lines that have repeated patterns of characters that vary in number from line to line, represent the lines and character patterns using while loops and string multiplication.</p>

<p>Another significant component of this assignment is the task of generalizing the program using a single value that can be changed to adjust the size of the figure.</p>

<p>This assignment will be graded both on “external correctness” (whether the program runs and produces exactly the expected output) and “internal correctness” (whether your source code follows the style guidelines in this document).</p>

<h2 id="style-guidelines">Style Guidelines</h2>

<h3 id="use-of-while-loops-nested-as-appropriate"><em>Use of while loops (nested as appropriate)</em></h3>

<p>This program is intended to test your knowledge of loops and nested loops. 
You may only use python constructs introduced in class.
If you are wondering wether or not you are allowed to use something, just ask!</p>

<h3 id="use-of-functions-for-structure-and-elimination-of-redundancy"><em>Use of functions for structure and elimination of redundancy</em></h3>

<p>Continue to use functions to structure your solution in such a way that the functions match the structure of the output itself.
Avoid significant redundancy; use functions so that no substantial groups of identical statements appear in your code.
No print statements should appear in your main function.
You do not need to use functions to capture redundancy in partial lines, such as the three groups of periods in the following line:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>|.../\/\....../\/\...|
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="source-code-aesthetics-commenting-indentation-identifier-names"><em>Source code aesthetics (commenting, indentation, identifier names)</em></h3>

<p>No line of your code should be over 100 characters long.
Give meaningful names to functions and variables in your code.
Follow Python’s naming standards about the format of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">function_and_variable_names</code>.
Also include a comment at the start of each function, describing its behavior.
Your comments should be in your own words.</p>

<h3 id="value-for-figures-size"><em>Value for figure’s size</em></h3>

<p>You should read in one (and only one) value to represent the size of the pieces of the figure.
Your figure must be based on that exact to receive full credit.</p>

<p><img src="./res/pattern.png" width="400" /></p>

<p>On any given execution your program will produce just one version of the figure.
However, you should refer to the value throughout your code, so that by simply changing the value, your program would produce a figure of a different size.
Your program should scale correctly for any constant value of 2 or greater.</p>

<h3 id="development-strategy-how-to-get-started"><em>Development Strategy (How to Get Started)</em></h3>

<p>This program is best completed in stages.
We strongly recommend the following development strategy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tables: Examine the output and write tables to discover the patterns of repeated characters on each line.</li>
  <li>Code w/o Variable Sizing: Completely write the Python code to draw the Rocket Ship at some default size (say 3).</li>
  <li>Code w/ Variable: Add a constant to your code so that the ship can scale to different sizes.</li>
</ul>

<p>To summarize, you do not have to worry about the variable at first, if it makes it easier to understand.
Write an initial program, using loop tables or pseudocode to help you deduce the patterns in the output.
After your figure looks correct at the default size, begin a second version with the variable.</p>

<h2 id="submission-and-grading">Submission and grading</h2>

<p>It is due on Monday, 7/3/2017 at 6:00pm.</p>

<p>You should put all of your code in to a python file named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rocketship.py</code>.
Submit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rocketship.py</code> to the associated D2L dropbox.
Following these turn-in and naming instructions closely is very important, because our grading scripts will depend on some of the details.
You may lose points if these instructions are not followed precisely!</p>
