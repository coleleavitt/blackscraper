  <h1 id="contact-manager">Contact Manager</h1>

<p><img src="./res/contact_manager.png" alt="contact manager graphic" height="175" /></p>

<p>Almost everyone these days has some type of contact set for managing the phone numbers and email addresses of friends, co-workers, and acquaintances.
Some use Google contacts( <a href="http://www.contacts.google.com">contacts.google.com</a> ), others use the contacts app on their phone, and some still even prefer old-fashioned paper-and-pencil organization.</p>

<p>In this assignment, you will implement a very simple contact organizer application in Python.
You should write a program called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">contact_manager.py</code>.
Using this application, you will be able to request contact information, as well as add new contacts to the contact manager.</p>

<p>You are NOT allowed to use dictionaries or lists (with one exception).
The exception is that you MAY use lists when it comes to reading in content from a file and splitting the lines, but you may not use them for storing the contacts for later access.
Thus, you should use sets and tuples.</p>

<p>Specifically, I recommend storing the contacts in a set of tuples.
The set will contain all of the contacts.
Each contact will be represented by a tuple, and each tuple should contain exactly three values: name, email, and phone number.
Your program should not allow a contact with the same name, email, and phone number to appear twice.
Using a set can help you maintain this property of the contact list!</p>

<h2 id="reading-from-a-file">Reading from a file</h2>

<p>The contacts should also be able to be loaded from a file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">contacts.txt</code>.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">contacts.txt</code> will have a file format that looks like the following:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Bill Jones | bjon@gmail.com | 520-999-8765
Sam Dekker | dekker@apple.com | 123-456-7890
Janet Keller | kel@yahoo.com | 456-2356
James Jamie | jjamie@gmail.com | 435-234-2334
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The precise names, emails, and phone numbers may vary.
Also, the number of contacts in the file may vary.
You should not assume that the file has any particular number of contacts in it, but you can assume that the file exists.
You can assume that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">contacts.txt</code> file is in the same directory as the program you are implementing (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">contact_manager.py</code>).</p>

<p>When <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">contact_manager.py</code> begins, it should read in and save all of the contact names, emails, and phone numbers into the program.
Since you wonâ€™t know how many contacts are in the file ahead-of-time, you should use a data structure to store the contacts.</p>

<h2 id="command-types">Command Types</h2>

<p>After optionally reading in all of the contacts from the contacts file, your program should <em>repeatedly</em> prompt the user to enter in commands.
Your program should support three main types of commands.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="showing-contacts">Showing contacts</h2>

<p>The user can enter a command of the form <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">show contacts with A B</code>, where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code> is either <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">email</code>, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">phone</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">B</code> is the name or email or phone to search for.
If the command that a user types begins with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">show contacts with</code>, then you can assume that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">B</code> components exist.
You should loop through the set of contacts and print out all of the ones where the name, email, or phone matches the search string.</p>

<p>Contacts should be reported with the following format:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>C's contact info:
email: A
phone: B
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, you should replace C, A, and B with the actual name, email, and phone number.
If there are no matching contacts, then print</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>None
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Either way, after processing the command, the program should prompt the user for the next command afterward.</p>

<h2 id="adding-a-contact">Adding a Contact</h2>

<p>When <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">add contact</code> is typed, the program will continue to prompt the user for three additional values: The name, email, and number of the contact.
Once it prompts the user for these three things, the program will <em>add</em> this new contact to the set of contact info that are stored in the program.
Below is an example of what this should look like:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; add contact
name: X
email: Y
phone: Z
contact added!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is what it would look like, but the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Y</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Z</code> values will be custom values entered by the user.
Each time an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">add contact</code> command is processed, a new contact should be added to the set.
You do not need to validate that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Y</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Z</code> are any particular type of input.</p>

<h2 id="exit">Exit</h2>

<p>If the user types <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exit</code> (all lower case) then the program should print an exit message and end.
For example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; exit
Goodbye!
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="extra-credit-saving">Extra Credit: saving</h2>

<p>Complete the following feature for extra credit.
When the user requests the program to exit, the program should <em>save</em> the contents of the contact set back into the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">contacts.txt</code> file.
This is important so that your program will remember all of the newly-added contacts when it runs again in the future.</p>

<p>If contacts were added via the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">add contact</code> command, these must be saved into the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">contacts.txt</code> file, using the format described earlier.</p>

<h3 id="other">Other</h3>

<p>If any other command is entered, your program should print <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Huh?</code> and then prompt the user for another command.</p>

<hr />

<p>I will be providing a lot of example runs/output on the diff-testing tool on the class website.
You should take care to make sure that the output of your program very closely matches the example runs that I post.
That will be the best way to make sure you are implementing the program correctly.</p>

<h3 id="diff-testing">Diff-Testing</h3>

<p>Several test-cases on the diff-testing tool on the class website.
The text of each test will have multiple parts.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The contents of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">contacts.txt</code> should be from the get-go (before you run the program)</li>
  <li>The program input</li>
  <li>The program printing/output that you should match</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that for some of the test cases, the ordering of contacts does not need to match perfectly in some cases.
This is because order is not guaranteed for elements in a set!</p>

<h2 id="submission-and-grading">Submission and grading</h2>

<p>It is due on 11/27/2018 at 7:00pm.</p>

<p>You should put all of your code in to a python file named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">contact_manager.py</code>.
Submit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">contact_manager.py</code> on Gradescope.</p>
