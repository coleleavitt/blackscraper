  <h1 id="csc-110---introduction-to-computer-programming-i">CSc 110 - Introduction to Computer Programming I</h1>
<h1 id="university-of-arizona-fall-2018">University of Arizona, Fall 2018</h1>

<h3 id="course-description">Course Description</h3>

<p>An introduction to programming with an emphasis on solving problems drawn from a variety of domains.
Topics include basic control and data structures, problem solving strategies, and software development tools and techniques.
Specifically, the Python programming language will be taught.</p>

<h3 id="location-and-time">Location and Time</h3>

<p>This class will meet M/W/F in Education 211.
However, there are two different meeting-times for CSc 110.
One meets 8:00-8:50am and the other 11:00-11:50am.
You must determine which you are registered for in UAccess, and you must attend the correct one.</p>

<p>This class also has a once-per-week section that meets in the Science Library, room 200.
You should be registered for either Monday or Wednesday 4:00-4:50pm.
Again, check which you are registered for in UAccess and make sure you attend the correct one.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites--co-requisites">Prerequisites &amp; Co-Requisites</h3>

<p>The only prerequisite is College Algebra.</p>

<h3 id="instructor--teaching-staff">Instructor &amp; Teaching Staff</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Instructor of Record:</strong> Benjamin Dicken</li>
  <li><strong>Office:</strong> Gould-Simpson 850</li>
  <li><strong>Email:</strong> bddicken@email.arizona.edu</li>
  <li><strong>Instructor Site:</strong> benjdd.com</li>
</ul>

<p>There will also be a number of student section leaders.
See the class website for a full list.</p>

<h3 id="course-format-and-teaching-methods">Course Format and Teaching Methods</h3>

<p>The course will have four meeting times per-week (Three standard classes, and one section).
The in-class experience will consist of a combination of lecture, programming demonstrations, and in-class activities.
This course will use active learning, peer-teaching, and flipped-classroom teaching techniques.</p>

<p>By <strong>active learning</strong>, I mean that class time won’t be just 50 minutes of me talking.
Instead, class meetings will include a number of in-class activities (ICAs) for you to work on individually and/or in a group.
Thus, you can spend some time “actively” learn, rather than “passively” listen to the instructor.</p>

<p>By <strong>peer-teaching</strong>, I mean that you will have opportunities to learn from your classmates, and vice-versa.
In many of the in-class activities, you will be able to work on groups and help each-other when necessary.</p>

<p>By <strong>flipped-classroom</strong>, I mean that you will often be assigned reading or other material to complete <em>before</em> attending each class meeting time.
By doing this, you will come to class with (at least some) preparation.
This will hopefully result in more class time allocated towards active learning!</p>

<h3 id="course-objectives--learning-outcomes">Course Objectives &amp; Learning Outcomes</h3>

<p>This successful CSc 110 student will be able to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use variables, control structures, basic data types, lists, dictionaries and functions to write 100 - 200 line programs.</li>
  <li>Break down a problem into an appropriate set of functions. Decompose tasks into loops and other control flow.</li>
  <li>Make assertions about code that contain loops, conditionals, and data structures.</li>
  <li>Find errors using print statement debugging, read and interpret error messages.</li>
  <li>Identify and fix redundancy, identify and fix bad structure at the function level, appropriate boolean usage, variable naming, commenting, know when to choose between a dictionary and list, know which type of loop to choose and which type of if construct to choose.</li>
  <li>Demonstrate computer science literacy.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>(These learning outcomes are derived from ones developed by Allison Obourn and other faculty at the UA).</em></p>

<h3 id="coursework-and-grading-policies">Coursework and Grading Policies</h3>

<p>The breakdown of grades in this course is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>43% exams</li>
  <li>32% programming assignments (PAs)</li>
  <li>10% attendance and participation</li>
  <li>10% flipped-learning reading quizzes</li>
  <li>5%  short PAs</li>
</ul>

<p>Attendance in class will be kept track of, and will contribute to 10% of the student’s final grade.
Each day of class and section there will be one or more attendance questions, which each student will answer on their device, and that will count as their attendance point for that day.
If you have an internet-access-capable portable device (laptop, smart-phone, tablet) you should bring one or more to class.
If you do not have access to this, talk to the instructor and special accommodations can be made.
Students must be in-class for this to count.</p>

<p>There will be assigned readings from the course textbook throughout the semester.
There will be a quiz due before each class (not including section) on the reading material.
In total these will contribute to 10% of the student grade.
Some class days may not have a quiz due, such as the first day of class, exam days, etc.</p>

<p>There will be weekly programming assignments throughout the semester, which will contribute to 32% percent of the student’s grade.
There will be around 14 of these.
The majority of these will be individual projects, but the instructor reserves the right to make some group-based.
Most of these PAs will be accompaied by a short PA.
Combined, these will be worth 5% of your course grade.
In total, the regular and small PAs are worth 37% of your grade.</p>

<p>There will be four exams throughout the course (including the final), for a total of %43.
The first three are worth 10% each, and the final exam is worth 13%.
These exams may cover material from class, the programming assignments, the final project, and the readings.</p>

<p>All of the exams (other than the final) will have both a group component and an individual component.
The group component with be worth 3% and the individual component will be worth 7%.</p>

<p>The instructor and teaching staff will do their best to have grades back to students within 1 week.
This includes, but is not limited to, grades for exams, projects, programming assignments, attendance, and quizzes.
Once a grade has been entered for a particular item on the digital grade-book, students have at most 5 days to dispute the grade.
This includes disputes related to excuses such as sickness, personal matters, dean’s excuses, etc.
If 5 days pass and there has not been such a request, the grade is final.</p>

<p>The correspondence between percentage grade and numeric grade is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Greater than 90% at least an A</li>
  <li>Greater than 80% at least a B</li>
  <li>Greater than 70% at least a C</li>
  <li>Greater than 60% at least a D</li>
  <li>Anything less, at least an E / F</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="late-days">Late Days</h3>

<p>In this class, you are given 3 late days for the semester.
What this means is that you are allowed to submit up to three assignments within 24 hours after the due date throughout the semester, without penalty.
You should not burn through all of these free late days on the first three assignments though!
Consider saving some for later in the semester, when you might be in dire need :).</p>

<h3 id="final-exam">Final Exam</h3>

<ul>
  <li>If you are in the 8:00-8:50am meeting time, then you must take the final exam Wednesday, December 12th, 8:00-10:00am.</li>
  <li>If you are in the 11:00-11:50am meeting time, the you must take the final exam Wednesday, December 12th, 10:30am-12:30pm.</li>
</ul>

<p>There will be no make-up opportunities for the final exam.
You must attend the final exam that corresponds with your class time.</p>

<h3 id="groups">Groups</h3>

<p>There will be 3-4 weeks of class between each of the exams.
During each of these time spans, I will break the class up into groups of 3-4 students.
Thus, in total, you will be in 4 different student groups throughout the course.
I highly encourage that you get-to-know all of your fellow students in each of your groups.
Not only is it a good way to meet new people, but there are several additional motivations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each group will sit at a table together, and will be able to collaborate on in-class activities.</li>
  <li>The first three exams will have a group component.
This group component will be taken in the same group that you were in leading up-to the exam.</li>
  <li>There is opportunity for extra credit for groups that have stellar attendance.
If the <em>entire</em> group is present for all but two class days in the 3-4 week span, each group member will receive a 5% bonus on their exam score.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="textbook">Textbook</h3>

<p>There is one required textbook for this course: 
<strong>Starting out with Python (4th).</strong>
The ISBN-13 number is <strong>978-0134444321</strong>.</p>

<p>This book is rather pricey on Amazon (around $100).
See for yourself: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0134444329/">https://www.amazon.com/dp/0134444329/</a></p>

<p>However, there is good news.
Via the inclusive access program at the UofA, you can get a digital copy of this textbook for less-than $30.
This should automatically be charged to your bursars account, and you should have access to the text through D2L from day-1 of the course.
If you would rather have a hard-copy, there is an option to upgrade (for a fee) so that you can have the digital book and a loose-leaf copy.
Though I don’t recommend it, you can also just purchase on Amazon.
It might also possible to opt-out of the inclusive access for this textbook.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about how this book is charged to your bursars account, how to access the textbook, when it will be charged, or anything else, contact the instructor directly.</p>

<h3 id="inclusive-access">Inclusive Access</h3>

<p>Course materials are being delivered digitally via D2L through the Inclusive Access program.
Please access the material through D2L the first day of classes to make sure there are no issues in the delivery, and if you are having a problem or question, it can be addressed quickly.
You automatically have access to the course materials FREE through September 3, 2018. 
You must take action (even if you have not accessed the materials) to opt-out if you do not wish to pay for the materials, and choose to source the content independently.
The deadline to opt-out for the 15-week course beginning August 20 th is 9:00pm MST, September 3, 2018.
If you do not opt-out and choose to retain your access, the cost of the digital course materials will appear on your October Bursars account.
Please refer to the Inclusive Access FAQs at <a href="https://shop.arizona.edu/textbooks/Inclusive.asp">https://shop.arizona.edu/textbooks/Inclusive.asp</a> for additional information.</p>

<h3 id="software">Software</h3>

<p>This class is an introduction to programming, specifically programming in <strong>Python</strong>.
Specifically, we will be using Python 3.5 or greater.
You can download it here: <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">https://www.python.org/downloads/</a>.
We will be using the <a href="https://codewith.mu">Mu Editor</a> to write Python code in.</p>

<p>If you have a personal computer, you should download and install Python and Mu on your machine.</p>

<p>As a CSc 110 student, you will also have access to the computer science lab, located in Gould Simpson room 228.
This room is equipped with a number of computers that you may use to work on your programs.
You will need to swipe your CatCard in order to enter the lab.</p>

<h3 id="getting-help">Getting Help</h3>

<p>Likely, some (or many) of you will find this course challenging.
The instructor and teaching staff provide a number of opportunities to receive help when you are stuck.</p>

<p>The instructor (Ben) will have several office hours each week.
There will also be 15-20 student section leaders (SLs) on the course teaching staff.
Each SL will have 1-3 hours of lab-hours.
Basically, this means that each SL will have time set-aside for helping students in the GS 228 lab.
A schedule will be posted to the class website after the semester begins.</p>

<p>If you are unable to make office or lab hours, you can also get help online.
We will be using the D2L forum, and you are welcome to post questions and get help from the SLs or other students.
However, you may <em>not</em> publicly post any of your code or solutions to problems.
If you are making a public post (visible to the entire class) make sure you do not include this.
If you would like to include this, post to the instructors only.</p>

<p>If you are ever stuck, ask for help!</p>

<h3 id="cheating">Cheating</h3>

<p>Unless otherwise specified, you may not work in groups on any coursework.
This includes quizzes, exams, programming drills, programming assignments, etc.
You may not share code, copy/paste code, or look at each-others code.
The instructor will be using software to help detect cheating (similar code).</p>

<p>If cheating is detected on your work, penalties may include (but are not limited to):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Receiving a grade of 0 on the programming assignment</li>
  <li>Being reported to the University</li>
  <li>Additional grade penalties</li>
  <li>Being dropped from the course (in extreme cheating situations)</li>
</ul>
