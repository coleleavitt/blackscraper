<h1>CSC 120: Programming Style</h1>

Programs are read much more often than they are written, so it is
important to pay attention to its <i>style</i>.  This document
lists (some of) the style requirements for programming assignments
in this class.  This list is <i><u>non-exhaustive</u></i>: 
you will be penalized if you violate these requirements; however,
you may also be penalized if your code uses poor style (in the latter
case, you will get a warning first, and penalized if the style
does not improve in subsequent assignments).
<p/>
For CSc 120, we will generally follow the style guidelines given in
<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" target="_blank">
  PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code</a>.  In particular, you should
adhere to the rules given below.  
<p/>
<b>NOTE:</b> These rules will be expanded as the semester progresses and we
cover new topics.  When this happens, you will be informed of the change.
<p/>
<h2>Docstrings</h2>
The style guidelines below refer to 
<a href="http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/python-docstrings" target="_blank">docstrings</a>.
A docstring for a function is a special kind of string that
begins with, and ends with, three double-quote (&quot;) characters,
and which provides documentation about the program entity it is attached to.

<h2>I. What you write</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
  <a href="https://obagy.com/cs120-fall24/LECTURES/01_Python_review.pdf" target="_blank"    >Program structure (Python review lecture slides):</a>
  Your program must have a main() function that calls the functions that you have
  written when decomposing the problem. In the link provided, search for <strong>program!</strong> to 
  see the slides on the basic structure of a program.  
  </li>
  <li>
  <strong>Function length:</strong> Your functions must be no longer than 40 lines of code, including in-line comments.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#code-lay-out" target="_blank">Layout</a>:
    <ul>
      <li>
	Indentation: 4 spaces per level.
      </li>
      <li>
	Line length: 79 characters.
      </li>
      <li>
	Use blank lines (sparingly) to indicate logical sections in your code.
      </li>
    </ul>	
    <p/>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#comments" target="_blank">Comments</a>:
    Your code should be appropriately commented.
    <ul>

      <li>
        <b>File-level docstrings:</b>
        <p>
        At the very beginning of each Python file you submit, you should place a docstring
	giving summary information about the program as a whole.  This summary should include
	the following information:
	<ol>
	  <li>
	    Name of file
         </li>
	  <li>
	    Name of author
         </li>
         <li>
	   Course number and semester
          </li>
	  <li>
	    Purpose of the program
          </li>
        </ol>
	<p/>
	For example:
          <pre>"""
    File: pokemon.py
    Author: Charm Ander
    Course: CSC 120, Spring 2024
    Purpose: This program processes a Pokemon file containing information 
        about Pokemon types and their properties. It calculates the average 
        values for each type's properties and then responds to a set of queries
        about the Pokemon properties. It answers the queries by printing the Pokemon
        type(s) that have the highest average value for that property.
"""
        </pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b> Function-header and method-header docstrings:</b>
        <p>
	For each function or method, provide a high-level summary of what the function or method does.
	This information should be given in the form of a docstring and should
	be placed immediately after the &quot;<b><tt>def</tt></b> <i>function_name(...):</i>&quot;
	line. The docstring should minimally include the following information:
	<p/>
	<ol>
	  <li>
	    a brief (one or two line) summary of what the function does;
          </li>
	  <li>
	    what its formal parameters and return value (if any) are;
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    any assumptions made by the function, i.e., any conditions that
	    must be met in order for the function to work correctly; and
          </li>
	  <li>
	    anything else that may be of interest about your code
	  </li>
	</ol>
	<p/>
	For example:
	<blockquote>
           <pre>def sum_csv_string(csv_string):
    """Add the numbers in a string of comma-separated values.
  
    Parameters: csv_string is a string of comma-separated numeric values.
  
    Returns: A number that is the sum of the values in the argument string.
    """
        </pre>
	</blockquote>
	For your convenience, a template is available <a href="docstring-template.txt">here</a>.
	<p/>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>In-line comments</b>
        <p>
	If the purpose or behavior of a piece of code is not obvious, comment it, with a 
        hashtag character.  However, don't just state the obvious&mdash;this only adds visual clutter.  
	For example, the following comment is clutter:
        <blockquote>
	  <b><tt>x = x + 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# increment x</tt></b>
	</blockquote>
<!--
	<p/>
	Examples of over-commenting are shown <a href="bad-style.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
	<p/>
-->
      </li>
      <li>
	  <b>Class docstring:</b>
        <p>
	For each class, give a docstring right after the
	&quot;<b><tt>class</tt></b> <i>MyClass:</i>&quot;
	line giving a high-level summary of the class, namely:
	</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>
	    a brief (one or two line) summary of what the class represents
          </li>
          <li>
	    its primary methods (i.e., not the setters and getters) in a general sense, but not
            in great detail since the methods will be documented individually
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    how it is to be constructed
          </li>
	  <li>
	    anything else that may be of interest about your code, i.e., warnings,
            noteworthy features, attributions, ways it could be improved, etc.
	  </li>
	</ol>
    <p>
      This docstring is supposed to be a <u>summary</u> of the class, so it
      should not generally mention any of the attributes or methods, nor go
      into too much detail about how it's implemented.  <b><font color=red>Make
      sure to write function headers for your methods as well, which will give
      more detail on those separately.</font></b>
    </p>
    <p>
	For example:
	</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>class Temp:
    """This class represents temperatures in either Celsius or Fahrenheit.
<!--
       The constructor creates an object that has attributes for the temperature, given as an int 
       or float, and the unit of the temperature, given as the string "C" or "F", to specify
       Celsius or Fahrenheit, respectively.
-->
       The class defines the methods for the comparison operations <, ≤, >, ≥, ==, and != using
       the special methods for each of those operations. Note that temperatures in different units can be
       compared since the underlying comparison operator will apply conversion formulas in order to
       compare them correctly.
    """

</pre>
<p>
An example of a method docstring is here:
<pre>

    def __eq__(self, other):
        """Returns True if the Temp object self is equal to the Temp object other and False otherwise. 
           If the temperatures are in different units, the method computes a common unit for the comparison.

           Parameters: other is another Temp object that this method needs to compare with the self object.

           Returns: True or False
        """
</pre>

        <b>Note:</b> You must provide a docstring for the <b><tt>__init__()</b></tt> method, but you do not need to provide 
        docstrings for simple getters and setters or for <b><tt>__str__()</b></tt>.

    <b>List comprehensions:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Don't use list comprehensions for code that has side effects.
      </li>
      <li>
	List comprehensions should not be nested.
      </li>
      <li>
	List comprehensions should not be &quot;too long&quot;.  For
	the purposes of this class, &quot;too long&quot; = 
	&quot;more than one line long&quot;.

-->
    </ul>
    <p/>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>II. How you write</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Avoid redundancy.</b>
    If you see the very similar code sequences&mdash;i.e., code that either looks similar, or behaves
    similarly&mdash;appear in more than one place, consider pulling them into a function.
    <p/>
    <i>Exception:</i> Small fragments of trivial code, e.g., two or three statements to initialize or
    increment a few variables.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Avoid unnecessary complexity.</b>
    Everything else being the same, simple code and data structures are better than complicated ones.
    Therefore,
    If a data structure or algorithm discussed in lecture does what
    you need to do, then&mdash;unless explicitly required by an assignment spec&mdash;you should
    not resort to something significantly more complex.
  </li>
</ol>
