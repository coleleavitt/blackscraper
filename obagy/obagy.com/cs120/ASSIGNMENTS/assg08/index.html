<h2>Hours and Observations (optional)</h2>
<p>
<h3>(No points)</h3>
<p>
We'd like to know more about how much time students are spending on the assignments and what students think about the assignments.  If you'd care to give us some data and/or some feedback, here's one way to do that:
<p>
Submit a text file named <code>observations.txt</code> with...
<ul>
<li>
Estimates of
<ol>
<li>How long it took you to complete Street
<li>How long it took you to complete Fake News with merge sort
</ol>
<p>We'll use a program to extract the data so please match the format of these examples:
<pre style="margin-left:3em">
street.py hours: 5
fake-news-ms.py hours: 3
</pre>
Use your best guess for the hours.  Integers or decimal fractions are fine.
<p>
If you want to add some detail, like "Did street.py while watching Netflix.", that's fine, but put it on a separate line.
<p>
We'd also like to know whether you made use of the hints provided for <code>street.py</code>.
<li>
<p>
General comments about the assignment are welcome, too. Was it too long, too easy, too detailed? Speak up! We appreciate all feedback, favorable or not.
<li>
<p>
If you made any interesting course-related observations or discoveries while working on the assignment, we'd love to hear about those, too.
</ul>
To make things a little more tangible, <a href=sample-observations.txt target=_blank>here</a> is an imagined <code>observations.txt</code>.  Note that there's no need to include your name, assignment number, section, etc.
