<h1>CSc 120: Phonetics and Pronunciation</h1>

There are two components to figuring out the pronunciation of an
English word: the sequence of sounds involved, and the emphasis
(or stress) on different syllables.  This document describes how
these two components are described in 
<a href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict#phones" target="_blank">the
Carnegie-Mellon Pronunciation Dictionary</a>.

<h2>Phonemes</h2>

A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme" target="_blank">phoneme</a>
is a unit of sound.  To describe the sounds uttered when pronouncing a word,
we give the sequence of phonemes that entails.
<p/>
One issue that we have to deal with is that in English, the same letter can
be pronounced in a number of different ways, e.g.:
<p/>
<ul>
  <li>
    the letter <b><u>i</u></b> in the words
    &quot;inside&quot; and &quot;item&quot;;
  </li>
  <li>
    the letter <b><u>c</u></b> in the words 
    &quot;cat&quot; and &quot;certain&quot;.
  </li>
</ul>
<p/>

The <a href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict#phones" target="_blank">the
CMU pronunciation dictionary</a> gets around this problem by using pairs of
letters to indicate specific sounds, i.e., phonemes.  There are 39 such phonemes;
they are shown <a href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict#phones" target="_blank">
here</a>.  For example:
<p/>
<ul>
  <li>
    the phoneme <b>IY</b> describes the &quot;ee&quot; sound in the words
    <i>meek</i>, <i>weak</i>, <i>me</i>, and <i>knee</i>; 
  </li>
  <li>
    the phoneme <b>TH</b> describes the &quot;th&quot; sound in <i>sixth</i> and
    <i>thousand</i>; and
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>DH</b> describes the sound of the letters &quot;th&quot; in <i>thee</i> and
    <i>weather</i>.
  </li>
</ul>
<p/>

<h2>Stress</h2>
In addition to the sounds of a word, different syllables of a word are often
emphasized, or stressed, differently.  Different patterns of stress can 
correspond to different word meanings, as 
<a href="http://EzineArticles.com/?expert=Heather_Hansen http://EzineArticles.com/?English-Word-Stress—Does-It-Really-Matter?&id=662774" target="_blank">this story</a> illustrates:
<p/>
<blockquote>
<i>&quot;A pilot once told me a story about a member of his cabin crew informing him 
that they had an in<u>VAL</u>id passenger on board. The pilot was a bit confused and 
wondered if the passenger didn’t have a ticket or wasn’t on the roster. He 
couldn’t figure out what the problem was. It wasn’t until the flight attendant 
continued to explain that the passenger was in a wheel chair and had special 
needs that the pilot realized he meant to say <u>IN</u>valid!&quot;</i>
</blockquote>
<p/>
The CMU pronunciation dictionary indicates stressed syllables by adding one
of the numbers <b>0</b>, <b>1</b>, or <b>2</b> to the phoneme for the vowel
sound of that syllable, with the following meaning:
<p/>
<blockquote>
  <b><tt>0</tt></b> : no stress<br/>
  <b><tt>1</tt></b> : primary stress<br/>
  <b><tt>2</tt></b> : secondary stress
</blockquote>
<p/>
For example:
<p/>
<blockquote>
  <table border="1" cellpadding="5" >
    <tr>
      <th>Word</th>
      <th>Phonemes</th>
      <th>Stressed syllables</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>weekly</td>
      <td>W &nbsp; IY1&nbsp; K &nbsp; L &nbsp; IY0</td>
      <td>The main (primary) stressed syllable is <u>week</u>; this stress
	is indicated by the '<b>1</b>' in the phoneme <b>IY1</b>.<br/> 
	The syllable &quot;ly&quot; is unstressed; this is indicated by
	the '<b>0</b>' in the phoneme <b>IY0</b>.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>computerize</td>
      <td>K &nbsp; AH0 &nbsp; M &nbsp; P &nbsp; Y &nbsp; UW1 &nbsp; T &nbsp; ER0 &nbsp; AY2 &nbsp; Z</td>
      <td>
	The main (primary) stress is on the syllable <u>put</u>; this is indicated
	by the '<b>1</b>' in the phoneme <b>UW1</b>.<br/>
	The secondary stress&mdash;i.e., a syllable that has some stress, but not
	as much as the primary stressed syllable&mdash; is <u>ize</u>; this is
	indicated by the '<b>2</b>' in the phoneme <b>AY2</b>.<br/>
	The other two syllables in this word (&quot;com&quot; and &quot;ter&quot;)
	are unstressed; this is indicated by
	the '<b>0</b>' in the corresponding phonemes.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
