<h1>CSc 120 (Spring 2025): Assignment Redo Opportunity</h1>

<h2>Submission Deadline: 7PM Mon May 5</h2>
You are being given the chance to rewrite a previous long assignment in order to replace your current score on that assignment with a better score.  Your score for the assignment will only be replaced if it is greater than your current score. Your score can only improve!
<p/>

<h2>Guidelines</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
   You can redo any <strong>long</strong> assignment of your choice. (That is, you can only redo the long portion of the assignment, not the short.)
  </li>
  <li>
   If there are two programs in the long assignment, you must submit them both.
  </li>
  <li>
   You <strong>must</strong> follow the restrictions given for the original assignment. 
  </li>
  <li>
   There is no Late Day submission for this redo opportunity. (The TAs need time to grade it before the Reading Day.)
  </li>
  <li>
  Once your submission has been graded, you will receive the higher score between your
  original submission and the new submission.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>How to submit</h2>
You must have the following <strong>TWO</strong> submissions to Gradescope by the deadline:
<p/>
<ol>
  <li>
    For the assignment you choose, you will submit your assignment to the <b><tt>FOR-LATE-SUBMISSIONS</b></tt>
    folder for that assignment. This will run the autograder for that assignment so that 
    you can test your submission as usual.
    <p/>
  </li>
  <li>
    In the folder <b><tt>Assignment-Redo-Opportunity</b></tt> in Gradescope, submit a file called <b><tt>redo.txt</b></tt> that 
    has your name and the assignment number.
    Here is an example of a <b><tt>redo.txt</b></tt> file:
    <blockquote>
    <table border="1">
    <tr>
    <td>
    <tt>
    Name: Student Smith<br/>
    Assignment: 8<br/>
    </tt>
    </td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ol>
