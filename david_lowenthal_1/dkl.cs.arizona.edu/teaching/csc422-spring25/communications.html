<h4> Course Communications </h4>
<p>
Class discussions and notes/clarifications from the TA and me will go out via Piazza, so you are responsible for 
signing up for and checking there.
You can access Piazza <a href="https://piazza.com/class/m5fm7c0eu6a15m"> here</a>.
If you have something personal to ask/tell me, send it directly to me by email. 
I will be using D2L for keeping track of grades, posting the syllabus, and
providing due dates on the calendar.
