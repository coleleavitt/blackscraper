Final Exam Schedule</a>.

<p>

<b>Unless otherwise specified, all assignments are due precisely at 8:00am on the due date.</b>&nbsp;    
<b>Please
note: </b>if your assignment is even one second late, it's late, without
exception.&nbsp;  You will have to turn the assignment in before the time
it is due.&nbsp; I will not allow "you missed by 1 minute, so it's ok."
In addition, any missed exam will result in a grade of zero.
<p>

<h4> Makeup Policy for Students Who Register Late </h4>

If you register late for the course, you will not be allowed to gain credit for any
written assignments, quizzes, programs, or exams whose due date has already passed.
