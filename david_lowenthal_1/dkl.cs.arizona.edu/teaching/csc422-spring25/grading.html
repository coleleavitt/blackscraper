<h4> Grading Scale and Policies </h4>
Grades will be assigned on the usual A-E basis. Grading will be absolute; 
there will be no curve. Achieving a 90% will <i>guarantee </i>an A, 80%
a B, and so on. However, when the final grades are given, it could be the
case, for example, that an 85% gets an A. Do not confuse this with a curve,
however. If everyone does A work (as I hope), everyone will get an A. If
everyone does C work, everyone will get a C. So that you know your grade
at all times, four fictitious students will be given grades for graded items.
These students will be named <i>Minimum A</i>, <i>Minimum B</i>, etc., indicating
the minimum score for each grade. 

<p>Grading will be divided as follows: </p>
   
<ul compact="COMPACT">
<li> Midterm and final exam: 50% (25% each)</li>
<li> Quizzes: 25%</li>
<li> Three Programming Assignments: 18%</li>
<li> Five Written assignments: 7%</li>
</ul>

<h4> Grading Mechanics </h4>
We will be using Gradescope for all grading.  
You can access Gradescope for CSc 422 <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/941111"> here</a>.

<h4> Quizzes </h4>
Starting in week 2, there will be one (announced) quiz per week; it may
be on either day.  Quizzes will start at 8am sharp <b> in class</b> and take approximately
10-15 minutes.  The quizzes will cover material from lectures and/or
assignments.  I will drop the lowest three quizzes.  There are no
excuses allowed for missing a quiz; if you miss the quiz, it will serve
as one of the three allowed drops.

<h4> Written Assignments </h4>
Written assignments <b> must</b> be typed (e.g., Word, Latex, or any text editor) and submitted to gradescope in pdf format. 
Additionally, any other directions I give must be followed 
<i> exactly</i>.
<b>Failure to follow directions (including not typing) will result
in a zero on the assignment</b>.

<h4> Grading Timeliness </h4>

I take deadlines seriously and expect you to turn everything in on time.
In return, I will adhere to the following grading return policies.
<ul compact="COMPACT">
<li> All assignments will be returned within two weeks.</li>
<li> All quizzes will be returned before Tuesday of the following week.</li>
<li> All exams will be returned within one week.</li>
<li> The grades will be kept up to date; you can find them on the 
<a href="https://d2l.arizona.edu/d2l/home/1561494" target="_blank"> CSc 422 Spring 2025 D2L site</a>.
</ul>

<h4> Regrades for Programming Assignments </h4>

If you lose points due to your program failing test cases, I will regrade using
the following policy.

<ul compact="COMPACT">
<li> You fix the code and resubmit it.</li>
<li> We re-execute your program on all the test cases, which yields a new grade.</li>
<li> We apply a penalty.  The <b>minimum</b> penalty is 10% per unique bug, 
but it can be more; the more significant the changes were to your code, the higher
the penalty.</li>
</ul>

<h4> Incompletes and Withdrawals </h4>
Requests for incomplete (I) or withdrawal (W) must be made in accordance with University policies, which are available
<a href="https://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/courses-credit/grading/grading-system" target="_blank">here</a>. 


<h4> Important Note on Grading </h4>
Your grade will be the one you earn.  
 Under no circumstances will your graduation or visa status
affect your grade.  This includes situations such as: (1) your 
parents are coming for graduation, (2) your relatives are flying in from halfway
around the world for your graduation,&nbsp; (3) you have a job lined up and
have to start immediately, (4) you got all A's up to this point, and you
have never received a grade below an A, and/or (5) you will have to leave the
country if you do not achieve a certain grade.
