<h4> Illnesses and Emergencies </h4>

<ul>
<li>
If you are sick, stay home. Except for seeking medical care, avoid contact with others and do not travel. 
<li>
Notify me if you will be missing up to one week of course meetings and/or assignment deadlines. 
<li>
If you must miss the equivalent of more than one week of class and have an emergency, the Dean of Students is the proper office to contact (DOS-deanofstudents@email.arizona.edu).  The Dean of Students considers the following as qualified emergencies: the birth of a child, mental health hospitalization, domestic violence matter, house fire, hospitalization for physical health (concussion/emergency surgery/coma/COVID-19 complications/ICU), death of immediate family, Title IX matters, etc.
<li>
Please understand that there is no guarantee of an extension when you are absent from class and/or miss a deadline.   
</ul>
