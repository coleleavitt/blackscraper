<h4> Code of Academic Integrity </h4>
Students are encouraged to share intellectual views and discuss freely the principles and applications of course materials. However, graded work/exercises must be the product of independent effort unless otherwise instructed. Students are expected to adhere to the UA Code of Academic Integrity as described in the UA General Catalog. See the policy
<a href="https://deanofstudents.arizona.edu/policies/code-academic-integrity"_blank">here</a>.

<p>
If you violate the code of academic integrity in any way, 
I will report you to the Dean of Students for a Code of Academic Integrity violation. 
The <b>minimum</b> sanction will be a loss
of credit on the work submitted <b>and</b> a full letter grade reduction of the final grade. 

<p>
Please understand that
uploading material (including your assignments and programs) from this course to a website other than D2L (or the class piazza) is strictly prohibited and will be considered a violation of the course policy and a violation of the code of academic integrity. Obtaining material (again, including assignments and programs) associated with this course (or previous offerings of this course) on a site other than D2L (or the class piazza), such as Chegg, Course Hero, etc. or accessing these sites during a quiz or exam is a violation of the code of academic integrity. 

<p>
Please also understand that
using artificial intelligence tools to solve problems and/or write computer programs is also
a violation of academic honesty.  This includes, but is not limited to, ChatGPT (and similar tools) or
CoPilot (and similar tools).
