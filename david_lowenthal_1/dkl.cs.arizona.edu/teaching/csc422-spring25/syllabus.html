<h4> Absence and Class Participation Policy </h4>

The UA's policy concerning Class Attendance, Participation, and Administrative Drops is available at
<a href="https://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/courses-credit/courses/class-attendance-participation" target="_blank">this link</a>.
<p>
The UA policy regarding absences for any sincerely held religious belief, observance or practice will be accommodated where reasonable.
See the policy <a href="http://policy.arizona.edu/human-resources/religious-accommodation-policy" target="_blank">here</a>.
<p>
Absences preapproved by the UA Dean of Students (or dean's designee) will be honored. See the policy
<a href="http://policy.arizona.edu/employmenthuman-resources/attendance" target="_blank">here</a>.

<p>
For CSc 422, there is no required attendance; however, <b> all quizzes will be given at the start of each class (i.e., 8am sharp) </b>.  

<html>
<head>
<body>

<h4> Lectures </h4>
 Attendance at lectures is optional. You are, however, responsible for all 
 material covered in lectures. 
 I will do my 
best to make lectures interesting. I believe that you won't just be   
able to read 
the notes and succeed.   
<p>You should come to lecture prepared. This means you have read the
assigned material in advance. 
</p>

<p>
Lectures will not be recorded.
   
<p>During lecture, please
do not hesitate to ask questions; you might
think your question is silly, but more likely, many people are wondering about
the same thing.

<h4> Final Examination </h4>
As mentioned above, the final exam is Thursday, May 15th, 8am-10am.
Please see the 
<a href="https://www.registrar.arizona.edu/courses/final-examination-regulations-and-information" target="_blank">  
Final Exam Regulations</a> 
and the 
<a href="https://registrar.arizona.edu/faculty-staff-resources/room-course-scheduling/schedule-classes/final-exams/final-exams-spring-2025" target="_blank">
Final Exam Schedule</a>.

<p>

<b>Unless otherwise specified, all assignments are due precisely at 8:00am on the due date.</b>&nbsp;    
<b>Please
note: </b>if your assignment is even one second late, it's late, without
exception.&nbsp;  You will have to turn the assignment in before the time
it is due.&nbsp; I will not allow "you missed by 1 minute, so it's ok."
In addition, any missed exam will result in a grade of zero.
<p>

<h4> Makeup Policy for Students Who Register Late </h4>

If you register late for the course, you will not be allowed to gain credit for any
written assignments, quizzes, programs, or exams whose due date has already passed.

<h4> Grading Scale and Policies </h4>
Grades will be assigned on the usual A-E basis. Grading will be absolute; 
there will be no curve. Achieving a 90% will <i>guarantee </i>an A, 80%
a B, and so on. However, when the final grades are given, it could be the
case, for example, that an 85% gets an A. Do not confuse this with a curve,
however. If everyone does A work (as I hope), everyone will get an A. If
everyone does C work, everyone will get a C. So that you know your grade
at all times, four fictitious students will be given grades for graded items.
These students will be named <i>Minimum A</i>, <i>Minimum B</i>, etc., indicating
the minimum score for each grade. 

<p>Grading will be divided as follows: </p>
   
<ul compact="COMPACT">
<li> Midterm and final exam: 50% (25% each)</li>
<li> Quizzes: 25%</li>
<li> Three Programming Assignments: 18%</li>
<li> Five Written assignments: 7%</li>
</ul>

<h4> Grading Mechanics </h4>
We will be using Gradescope for all grading.  
You can access Gradescope for CSc 422 <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/941111"> here</a>.

<h4> Quizzes </h4>
Starting in week 2, there will be one (announced) quiz per week; it may
be on either day.  Quizzes will start at 8am sharp <b> in class</b> and take approximately
10-15 minutes.  The quizzes will cover material from lectures and/or
assignments.  I will drop the lowest three quizzes.  There are no
excuses allowed for missing a quiz; if you miss the quiz, it will serve
as one of the three allowed drops.

<h4> Written Assignments </h4>
Written assignments <b> must</b> be typed (e.g., Word, Latex, or any text editor) and submitted to gradescope in pdf format. 
Additionally, any other directions I give must be followed 
<i> exactly</i>.
<b>Failure to follow directions (including not typing) will result
in a zero on the assignment</b>.

<h4> Grading Timeliness </h4>

I take deadlines seriously and expect you to turn everything in on time.
In return, I will adhere to the following grading return policies.
<ul compact="COMPACT">
<li> All assignments will be returned within two weeks.</li>
<li> All quizzes will be returned before Tuesday of the following week.</li>
<li> All exams will be returned within one week.</li>
<li> The grades will be kept up to date; you can find them on the 
<a href="https://d2l.arizona.edu/d2l/home/1561494" target="_blank"> CSc 422 Spring 2025 D2L site</a>.
</ul>

<h4> Regrades for Programming Assignments </h4>

If you lose points due to your program failing test cases, I will regrade using
the following policy.

<ul compact="COMPACT">
<li> You fix the code and resubmit it.</li>
<li> We re-execute your program on all the test cases, which yields a new grade.</li>
<li> We apply a penalty.  The <b>minimum</b> penalty is 10% per unique bug, 
but it can be more; the more significant the changes were to your code, the higher
the penalty.</li>
</ul>

<h4> Incompletes and Withdrawals </h4>
Requests for incomplete (I) or withdrawal (W) must be made in accordance with University policies, which are available
<a href="https://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/courses-credit/grading/grading-system" target="_blank">here</a>. 


<h4> Important Note on Grading </h4>
Your grade will be the one you earn.  
 Under no circumstances will your graduation or visa status
affect your grade.  This includes situations such as: (1) your 
parents are coming for graduation, (2) your relatives are flying in from halfway
around the world for your graduation,&nbsp; (3) you have a job lined up and
have to start immediately, (4) you got all A's up to this point, and you
have never received a grade below an A, and/or (5) you will have to leave the
country if you do not achieve a certain grade.

<h4> Dept. of Computer Science Code of Conduct </h4>

The Department of Computer Science is committed to providing and maintaining a supportive educational environment for all.  We strive to be welcoming and inclusive, respect privacy and confidentiality, behave respectfully and courteously, and practice intellectual honesty.  Disruptive behaviors (such as physical or emotional harassment, dismissive attitudes, and abuse of department resources) will not be tolerated.  The complete Code of Conduct is available on our department web site.  We expect that you will adhere to this code, as well as the UA Student Code of Conduct, while you are a member of this class.

<p>
You can find the code of conduct <a href="https://www.cs.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/codeofconduct.pdf"> here</a>.


<h4> Classroom Behavior Policy </h4>

To foster a positive learning environment, students and instructors have a shared responsibility. We want a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment where all of us feel comfortable with each other and where we can challenge ourselves to succeed. To that end, our focus is on the tasks at hand and not on extraneous activities (e.g., texting, chatting, reading a newspaper, making phone calls, web surfing, etc.).

<p>
Students are asked to refrain from disruptive conversations with people sitting around them during lecture. Students observed engaging in disruptive activity will be asked to cease this behavior. Those who continue to disrupt the class will be asked to leave lecture or discussion and may be reported to the Dean of Students. 

<p>
Please refrain from using personal electronics, such as laptops and iPads, except for taking notes. 

<h4>Threatening Behavior Policy</h4>
The UA Threatening Behavior by Students Policy prohibits threats of physical harm to any member of the University community, including to oneself. See 
<a href="http://policy.arizona.edu/education-and-student-affairs/threatening-behavior-students" target="_blank">here</a>. 

<h4> UA Nondiscrimination and Anti-Harassment Policy </h4>
The University is committed to creating and maintaining an environment free of discrimination; see the policy
<a href="http://policy.arizona.edu/human-resources/nondiscrimination-and-anti-harassment-policy" target="_blank">here</a>.

<body>
            
<h4>Addressing Students</h4>

What is visible to me is the class roster in UAccess.  Please ensure that your
identfying information in UAccess is up to date, so that I will know how you prefer to be addressed.
In addition, I ask students to address each other in their preferred way.

</body>
</html>

<html>
<body>

<h4> Malware </h4>

Do not turn in "malware" as a prank.  ("Malware" is software that intentionally does harm to a computer, computer data, computer networks, etc.)  Malware is a federal crime (see <a href="https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/97-1025.pdf">here</a> for more information). 
If you turn in malware, I will refer the situation to the proper law enforcement
authorities, as well as recommend a harsh punishment.

<h4> Code of Academic Integrity </h4>
Students are encouraged to share intellectual views and discuss freely the principles and applications of course materials. However, graded work/exercises must be the product of independent effort unless otherwise instructed. Students are expected to adhere to the UA Code of Academic Integrity as described in the UA General Catalog. See the policy
<a href="https://deanofstudents.arizona.edu/policies/code-academic-integrity"_blank">here</a>.

<p>
If you violate the code of academic integrity in any way, 
I will report you to the Dean of Students for a Code of Academic Integrity violation. 
The <b>minimum</b> sanction will be a loss
of credit on the work submitted <b>and</b> a full letter grade reduction of the final grade. 

<p>
Please understand that
uploading material (including your assignments and programs) from this course to a website other than D2L (or the class piazza) is strictly prohibited and will be considered a violation of the course policy and a violation of the code of academic integrity. Obtaining material (again, including assignments and programs) associated with this course (or previous offerings of this course) on a site other than D2L (or the class piazza), such as Chegg, Course Hero, etc. or accessing these sites during a quiz or exam is a violation of the code of academic integrity. 

<p>
Please also understand that
using artificial intelligence tools to solve problems and/or write computer programs is also
a violation of academic honesty.  This includes, but is not limited to, ChatGPT (and similar tools) or
CoPilot (and similar tools).
