Each of the TAs has successfully completed this class (or its
equivalent) and is compensated by the Department of Computer Science
to help me help you learn the material.
<!-- In addition to leading supplementary instruction meetings, -->
They grade homeworks,
<!--and quizzes, -->
do the bulk of grading on the exams, let me know what topics seem to be
especially baffling to the students, and even hold office hours.
I expect that you'll find the TA group to be a valuable resource.
</p>

<!--
<p>
The Group number represents the subset of the students for whom the TA
is the primary grader.  Each student's group number will be communicated
to the student individually by email.
</p>
-->

<p>
We will each offer in-person office hours.
<!-- TA Office Hours are held in either G-S 837 or 849. -->
The schedule will be announced as soon as we can create it.
Please keep in mind that it is possible to meet with each of us outside of
office hours, too.  Contact us to make an appointment.

            and logically sound proof that convincingly argues the truth
            of the conjecture.
            </li>
       <li> Demonstrate ability to convert between logic and set expressions.
            </li>
       <li> Explain and apply the basic properties of relations and functions
            to more advanced concepts built upon them.
            </li>
<!--
       <li> Solve specific types of recurrence relations and prove that the
            solutions define the same sequences as the original relations.
            </li>
       <li> Given a counting problem, produce the correct quantity of potential
            outcomes by identifying and applying the appropriate counting
            concepts.

<p>
Most, if not all, assignments in this class will be individual assignments,
to be worked on outside of class.  <i>All individual work assigned to you
in this class is to be completed only by you.</i>
It is not acceptable for you to `borrow' (a.k.a. steal, copy, coerce, etc.)
solutions or parts of solutions from other entities (people, books, web sites,
artificial intelligences, etc.) or have other entities create part or all
of your solutions for you.  Yes, acquiring answers and solutions
via the Internet is a violation of academic dishonesty!
However, it <b>IS</b>
acceptable (and encouraged!) for students to help one another understand
the assignment requirements and other high-level issues.
In short, do your own work, but feel
free to discuss conceptual difficulties with each other.
Of course, you may always ask me or a TA for help, but
don't expect that we'll just hand you solutions; we'll make you work for them.
Doing is learning!
</p>

<p>
The class policy on cheating is simple: If we determine by a preponderance
of the evidence that a student or students violated one or more
of the policies of academic conduct governing this class, at minimum
<b>all</b> complicit students will receive no points for the academic activity
or activities in question. Additional sanctions are possible depending
on the circumstances of the offense(s) and the policies of the department,
university, and Arizona Board of Regents, up to and including expulsion
from the university.  Academic integrity infractions are reported to
both the Dean of Students and the Dean of the College of Science.
If you have a history of violations, the penalty is likely to be much worse
than just a zero on an assignment.  <i>Multiple violations in this class
will result in a recommendation of a failing course grade, at minimum.</i>
We take academic dishonesty very seriously, as you should be able to tell;
we expect you to take it just as seriously.
</p>

<p>
<b>Please</b> take the time to read the
references linked above.  Ignorance of the policies is not an acceptable
excuse for their violation.
For your convenience, here is the section of the University's 
Code of Academic Integrity entitled "Prohibited Conduct":
</p>

<table class="quote">
  <tr>
    <td>
Conduct prohibited by this Code consists of all forms of academic dishonesty,
including, but not limited to:
1. Cheating, fabrication, facilitating academic
dishonesty, and plagiarism as set out and defined in the Student Code of
Conduct, ABOR Policy 5-308-E.11, and F.1.
2. Submitting an item of academic work that has previously been submitted
or simultaneously submitted without fair citation of the original work
or authorization by the faculty member supervising the work.
3. Violating required disciplinary and professional ethics rules contained
or referenced in the student handbooks (hardcopy or online) of undergraduate
or graduate programs, or professional colleges.
4. Violating discipline specific health, safety or ethical requirements
to gain any unfair advantage in lab(s) or clinical assignments.
5. Failing to observe rules of academic integrity established
by a faculty member for a particular course.
6. Attempting to commit an act prohibited by this Code.
Any attempt to commit an act prohibited by these rules shall be subject
to sanctions to the same extent as completed acts.
7. Assisting or attempting to assist another to violate this Code.

       <p>
       I use the common 90-80-70-60 grading scale.  It's possible
       (though unlikely) that
       final grade cutoffs will be lowered a little (from 89.5% to
       88.5% for the bottom of the 'A' range, for example) but they will
       never be raised.  I make such determinations only at the end of
       the term, after the final exam has been graded.

       We do not take (and so do not grade you on)
       attendance during lectures.  That said,
       we strongly recommend that you attend all of the lectures.
       Experiencing, and contributing to, in-person lectures
       greatly improves learning.
       Please be aware that there is no guarantee of due-date extensions or
       any other accommodations when you are absent from class and/or
       miss a deadline.
       This includes students who enroll in the class after the first day
       of class.  Please contact me to discuss your situation.
       Absences pre-approved by the UA Dean of Students (or dean’s designee)
       will be honored.
       <p />

       <p>
       If you feel sick, or may have been in contact with someone
       who is infectious, stay home.  Except for seeking medical care,
       avoid contact with others and do not travel. 
       Notify your instructor(s) if you will be missing up to one week
       of course meetings and/or assignment deadlines. 
       If you must miss the equivalent of more than one week of class
       due to a qualified emergency
       (the birth of a child, mental health hospitalization,
       domestic violence matter, house fire,
       hospitalization for physical health
       (concussion/emergency surgery/coma/COVID-19 complications/ICU),
       death of immediate family, Title IX matters, etc.),
       the Dean of Students is the proper office to contact.
       <p />

  <li> <strong>Late Enrollment:</strong>

       <p>
       If you enroll in the class after the first graded activity has been
       assigned, please see the instructor to discuss possible adjustments
       to due dates.
       </p>
       </li>

  <li> <strong>Administrative Drops:</strong>

       <p>
       Every semester, students enroll in introductory CS classes but
       do not submit any work, resulting in a grade of 'E' at the end
       of the term.  To prevent this, after the end of the second week,
       I will be administratively dropping all students who have not
       submitted any activities collected prior to the no-W drop date.
       </p>
       </li>

  <li> <strong>Supplemental Instruction:</strong>

       <p>
       This class includes, and strongly encourages (but cannot
       <i>require</i>) you to attend, a number of weekly supplemental
       instruction sessions, run by the TAs.
       Details about their dates, times, and content will be announced soon.
       </p>
       </li>

  <li> <strong>Homeworks:</strong>

       <p>
       The idea behind the homework <!-- and program -->
       assignments is to help you get more
       hands-on experience with the material as preparation for the
       exams.  The more practice you get, and the more you 'step back'
       and examine the context of the exercises as you do them,
       the more you will benefit.
       </p>

    <ul>
    <li> <i>Quantity and Frequency:</i>

       <p>
       Expect to complete seven homework assignments during this
       course.  Homeworks are typically due a week from the date on which
       they are assigned.  There will be weeks without homeworks due.  Usually,
       these are the weeks of, or the weeks just after, an exam.
       </p>
       </li>

    <li> <i>Facilities:</i>

       <p>
       For the most part, the homework assignments in this class are
       "written" (e.g., word-processed, or neatly hand-written and scanned),
       although
       you can expect that we'll ask you to program a little bit, too,
       now and then.  When programs are required, you can use the
       department instructional machines, or your own computer(s),
       as the situation permits.
       </p>
       </li>

    <li> <i>Legibility:</i>

       <p>
       We expect your written work to have your answers clearly marked,
       to include sufficient detail to enable us to follow your
       reasoning, and to be legible so that we can easily read your words,
       understand your explanations,
       and decipher your diagrams.  Difficulties in any of these areas
       will likely result in a loss of points.  This isn't high
       school; you are preparing yourselves for careers, and as such
       you need to get in the habit of preparing your work
       in a professional manner.  Here's another way to look at it:
       Make it easy for us to see that you know your stuff.
       </p>

       <p>
       You are encouraged (but not required)
       to learn and use the scientific document preparation
       package <i>LaTeX 2e</i> to typeset your homework submissions.  Not
       only will this help you produce readable answers, you will be ready
       for future classes that may require the use of
       this tool.  <i>LaTeX 2e</i> tutorials and samples are available
       from the class web page.
       </p>
       </li>

    <li> <i>Incomplete or Incorrect Homeworks:</i>

       <p>
       On the due date, turn in what you have accomplished, whether or not
       it is complete.  If you feel that you deserve
       an extension of the due date based on <i>exceptional</i>
       circumstances, contact me and I will consider your request.
       </p>

       <p>
       Each homework problem will be worth a certain number of 
       points.  A complete, correct, and legible answer will receive
       full credit.  We will award partial credit to incomplete and/or
       semi-legible answers when appropriate.  If you feel that your
       homework was graded improperly, first please contact a TA to
       discuss your concerns.
       </p>
       </li>

    <li> <i>Discussing Your Score:</i>

       <p>
       We deduct points from imperfect homework answers so that you know
       where you need to improve on future assignments.
       If you don't understand why you lost points for a particular
       problem, or you would like to hear specific suggestions for
       improvement, we want you to talk with us about your concerns.
       </p>

       <p>
       For this discussion to be most productive, you should contact a
       TA and arrange a mutually-agreeable meeting time.
       Come to the meeting with your graded homework at hand and a list of your
       specific questions and concerns (so that you don't forget anything).
       </p>

       <p>
       If, after this meeting, you are not satisfied, make an appointment
       to discuss your concerns with me.  Always meet with a TA
       first; they have first-hand knowledge of the grading.
       </p>

       <p>
       To keep grading discussions from dragging out across the semester,
       <i>you need to let a member of the class staff know
       about your grading concerns within one week
       of the class (not you individually) receiving the graded assignment</i>,
       unless there are exceptional circumstances that prevent you
       from doing so.
       Any complaints about scores received after that week will not result
       in any score changes (but we'd still be happy to talk about your
       concerns).
       </p>
       </li>

    <li> <i>Returning of Graded Assignments:</i>

       <p>
       We expect to be able to grade and return assignments before the
       next like assignment is due.  For example, expect the first homework to
       be graded before the second homework is due.
       If the grading of an assignment will take more time,
       we will keep you informed.
       </p>

       </li>

    <li> <i>Late Assignment Policy:</i>

         <p>
         Each assignment will have a clearly stated due date and
         time.  Typically, the time will be five minutes after the start of
         class on the due date.  Electronic submissions received after
         that time will be considered late.  Assignments submitted within
         the first 24 hour period after the due date and time are
         considered to be one day late.  Any day of the
         week, including Saturdays, Sundays, and all holidays, count
         as days for the purpose of determining lateness. 
         </p>

         <p>
         At the start of the term, you are granted three no-penalty late days
         that can be used on the seven graded homeworks.  You are allowed to
         use at most one late day on a homework.  If you have exhausted your
         late days and turn in another homework one day late,
         the maximum possible score on that homework is 75%.
         In the absence of extreme circumstances (see the Exam section, below),
         homeworks more than one day late will not be accepted,
         regardless of how many late days you possess.
         We have these limits to give the TAs adequate time to grade homeworks.
         <!-- encourage you to take the due dates seriously -->
         </p>
<!--
         <p>
         Final detail:  No assignment will be accepted after the start
         of Reading Day.
         </p>
-->
       </li>

    </ul>
    </li>

  <li> <strong>Quizzes:</strong>

       <p>
       I am planning to give about a dozen unannounced quizzes this semester.
       Why `about' a dozen?  I expect to average
       one quiz per non-exam week of the semester.  This means that there
       will be weeks with no quiz, but there are likely to be weeks
       with multiple quizzes.  The quizzes will not be on predictable days
       of the week, but are usually given at the end of the class period
       so that students who finish early can leave early.
       </p>

       <p>
       <i>I will not be giving any make-up quizzes.</i>
       Why not?  Of the dozen quizzes I anticipate giving, at most your
       best ten quiz scores will count.  If the class response rate on
       the end-of-semester Student Course Survey (a.k.a. class evaluations)
       exceeds 50%, only your best nine will count.  If the rate exceeds 66.7%,
       only your best eight will count.  This gives you multiple opportunities
       to have an off-day, or to miss a quiz for whatever reason, and still be
       able to have a solid quiz average at the end of the semester.
       </p>

       <p>
       The use of electronic devices (e.g., calculators) is NOT permitted
       on quizzes unless warranted by special circumstances.
       </p>

       <p>
       As with homeworks, <i>we will entertain quiz grade reconsideration
       requests only within one week after the time the quiz was returned to
       the class</i>. <!-- (not to you individually). -->
       </p>

       </li>

  <li> <strong>Exams:</strong>

       <p>
       Exam formats will be fairly consistent throughout the semester.
       Exams will contain short answer and problem-solving
       questions, but true/false, multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank,
       and code-writing questions are also possible.  The use
       of calculators or any other electronic devices is NOT permitted on
       exams unless warranted by special circumstances.
       </p>

       <p>
       I expect all students to take the exams at the announced exam times.
       I give make-up exams only in <i>extreme</i> circumstances.
       I decide if a circumstance is "extreme."
       For example, being in a documented car accident on the way to the
       exam is likely to count as an extreme circumstance.  Circumstances
       that are <strong>not</strong> considered to be extreme include losing a
       cell phone, breaking up with a significant other, forgetting to
       set/heed an alarm clock, having the sniffles, consoling a depressed
       house plant, etc.  Please be aware
       that missing a midterm exam isn't necessarily a disaster; see below.
       </p>

       <ul class="subsublist">

       <li> <i>Midterm Exams:</i>

            <p>
            General Information: Midterms will
            focus on the material covered in class and on the assignments
            since the time of the previous midterm
            (or the start of the term in the case of the first midterm).
            As new material in this class usually builds upon the old,
            you should expect that your knowledge of material covered
            by previous exams will be necessary for success on subsequent
            exams.
            </p>

            <p>
            Grading Timetable:  We will do our best to return graded
            midterm exams within two class meetings of the date of the exam.
            If grading will take more time, we will keep you informed.
            </p>

            <p>
            Regrade Requests:  After midterm exams are graded,
            they will be returned to you.
            If you feel that your exam was graded improperly, prepare
            a brief memo that explains which problems concern you and why.
            <i>Within one week of the date on which the exam was returned to
            the class</i>, submit the memo to me.
            <strong>I will regrade the entire exam</strong>,
            paying particular attention to
            the concerns you highlighted in the memo.  Because errors in
            grading can cause scores to be too high as well as too low,
            it is possible that your grade will go down as a result of the
            regrade.  Be sure to review your entire exam before you
            ask for a regrade.
            </p>

            <p>
            By department policy, final exams are <i>required</i> in all
            undergraduate classes.  By university policy,
            final exams must be held during
            the time slot assigned by the final exam schedule.
            I have listed that time near the beginning of
            this syllabus.  (If you see that I have listed the exam
            time incorrectly, please let me know.)
            <b>The final will be comprehensive</b> and
            will have a format similar to that of the midterms.
            If you miss the final under less than extreme circumstances,
            you will receive a score of zero for the final.
            </p>

            <p>
            At the end of the semester, I will replace your lowest midterm
            exam score with a percentage-equivalent copy of your final exam
            score, but only if the final score is higher than at least one
            of your midterm scores. (Thus, this is a potential bonus but
            never a penalty.) I do this to reward you for demonstrating an
            improved mastery of the material over the course of the
            semester.  However, it can also help you if you should miss a
            midterm because your car broke down, your alarm clock didn't
            go off, you purchased an ill-advised tattoo,
            or any other non-extreme quirk of fate.
            Please note that should you miss multiple midterms under
            sub-extreme circumstances, you will
            definitely get a zero for those additional missed midterms.
            </p>
            </li>

       <li> <i>Exam Seating:</i>

            <p>
            If room capacity permits, leave a seat vacant between you
            and your neighbor.  If need be, we will reseat students
            before or even during an exam to maintain an honest
            evaluation environment for all students.  Don't be surprised
            if you see me taking pictures of the class during the exam.
            That action probably doesn't mean that we think that someone
            is cheating; it also happens to be a convenient way
            to document attendance.

       <li> <i>Maintain an Effective Learning Environment:</i>
            To foster a positive learning environment, students and instructors
            have a shared responsibility. We want a safe, welcoming, and
            inclusive environment where all of us feel comfortable
            with each other and where we can challenge ourselves to succeed.
            To that end, our focus is on the tasks at hand
            and not on extraneous activities (e.g., texting, chatting,
            reading a newspaper, making phone calls, web surfing, etc.).
            <p />
            </li>

       <li> <i>No Audible Alerts:</i>  While class is in session,
            please disable all audible alerts on your communication devices
            in favor of an inaudible alert mode, or just turn the device off.
            If you receive a call or message that requires an immediate
            verbal response, kindly leave the class before replying.
<!--
            Should you be expecting an urgent call and wish to leave your
            phone's ringtone enabled, all I ask is that you tell me in advance
            so that I know not to glare at you when your phone rings.

            </li>

       <li> <i>Use of Electronic Devices During Lecture:</i>
            I ask that you limit your in-class use
            of electronic devices (laptop computers, tablets, cell phones,
            etc.) to activities that are directly relevant to the class.
            Such activities may include taking notes and running example
            programs from the class web page.
            Playing games, following your friends on social media, and
            watching TV shows, movies, and cute cat videos are all examples
            of activities you should not be doing in class.
            You're paying a lot of money to be in this class;
            you should pay attention and get your money's worth.
            Your classmates are also paying to be here; your behavior should
            not distract them, either.
            Should your activities become a distraction to me or to your
            classmates, I'll ask you to either stop or to leave the room
            until you are able to focus on the class material.
            <p />
            </li>

       <li> <i>Asking Questions:</i>  Is encouraged!  During class, feel free
            to interrupt with questions whenever
            they occur to you.  I may ask you to hold off on your question
            for a few moments if I'm in the middle of an explanation,
            but I'll come back to you.  If I forget, just remind me.
            <p />
            </li>
            
       <li> <i>Answering Questions:</i>  Is also encouraged!
            I frequently ask questions of the class during lectures
            to judge the level of understanding (and to break up the
            monotony).
            Some students really like answering questions, sometimes to
            the point of discouraging anyone else from answering.  If
            you are an eager answerer, pace yourself; let someone else
            answer an easy one once in a while, and save the hard ones for
            yourself.
            <p />
            </li>

       <li> <i>Chatting with Your Classmates:</i>  Sometimes you can't
            resist making a comment to your friend.
            I don't want you to injure yourself by trying to
            hold it in.  Go ahead and whisper that comment.
            Just don't let it grow into a
            conversation.  If what you have to say is that irresistibly
            juicy, write a note or hold the thought until after class.
            We're confident that the passage of time will not diminish its wit
            and hilarity.
            The point, of course, is to avoid distracting the instructor and/or
            other students.

       <p />
       </li>

  <li> <strong>Response Time:</strong>

       <p>
       The instructor and the TAs will attempt to reply to email
       and discussion board postings from students within 24 hours
       (48 hours on weekends/holidays).  This means that if you wait until
       the evening before an assignment is due to post a question,
       you may not get a reply before the due date and time.  There's
       a classic sentence that covers this:  <i>A failure to plan on your
       part does not constitute an emergency on our part.</i>
       We want to help, but, like you, we have tasks other than email and
       discussion board postings that require our attention.
       </p>

       <p>
       Important note:  We encourage you to answer the posted questions
       of other students if and when you are able to do so.
       This is why we have a discussion board that is open to the entire class.
       </p>

       <p>
       To help your email stand out in our inboxes, please prefix your
       subject lines with "CSc 144:", as in "CSc 144:  My virtual pet ate
       my digital homework!".  Doing this will help reduce the chance
       that your email is inadvertently marked as 'spam'.

  <li> <strong>Extra Credit:</strong>

       <p>
       <i>There will be no opportunities for extra credit points.</i>
       Use your time to concentrate on doing well on the assigned work.
       If your grade in this class is important to you, start taking this

       If you find yourself thinking about dropping this (or any other)
       class, first make sure that that's what you really want to do.
       Chatting with the instructor and your academic advisor may help.
       If you drop within the first two weeks of the semester,
       there will be no notation on your transcript; to an employer,
       it will be as though you'd never enrolled.
       During the third through the tenth weeks,
       a drop will be recorded on your transcript by a 'grade' of "W"
       ("withdrawn").  After the tenth week, dropping becomes
       a challenge, because you will need to provide documentation
       to the dean's office explaining why you were unable to drop the class
       during the first ten weeks of the semester.

       <p>
       The university's course catalog contains all of the details
       about incompletes, but this is the key sentence:
       </p>

       <table class="quote">
         <tr>
           <td>
           The grade of I may be awarded only at the end of a term,
           when all but a minor portion of the course work has been
           satisfactorily completed.  The grade of I is not to be awarded
           in place of a failing grade or when the student is expected
           to repeat the course; in such a case, a grade other than I
           must be assigned.
           </td>
         </tr>
       </table>

       <p>
       The phrase "a minor portion" is accepted to mean "20% or less."
       To qualify for an incomplete, a student must have maintained
       a passing grade for the class until the term is nearly 
       complete, and then, due to an unusual and substantiated cause
       beyond the student's control, the student is unable to complete
       the class work.  In short, you can't get an "I" just because
       you aren't happy with your grade.

       <p>
       Acts of violence at educational institutions are increasing in
       frequency.  Should you find yourself in danger of being attacked,
       CIRT recommends "Run, Hide, Fight":  First, try to escape.
       If you cannot, find a place to hide.  As a last resort, fight using
       anything you have available as a weapon.
       For a list of emergency procedures for all types of incidents,
       please visit the CIRT link, above.
       </p>

       <p>
       The university offers UAlert, a free service that notifies users of
       active incidents on or near campus.  Members of the campus community
       are added to the system automatically.
       Visit the link, above, to adjust your settings.
