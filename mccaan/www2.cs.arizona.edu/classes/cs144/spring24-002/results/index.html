2024-05-05 4:30 p.m. -- Here are the course grades, and the final exam
scores.  My grading program doesn't show all of the scores at the end
of the semester, for privacy reasons.  The final exam histogram is
at the bottom, as usual.  And, you should be able to see your final
in Gradescope now.  One student is dealing with a medical emergency;
when that student completes the class, the stats will change a little.

The exam average is comparable with that of the 3rd midterm, which is good,
as the final is comprehensive, and longer.  The number of `E' grades is high,
but note that a significant quantity of them show a score of 0 on the final.
(Zeroes are not included in the exam statistics, BTW.)  For a variety
of reasons, every semester quite a few students stop turning in assignments
and stop taking exams, but don't withdraw from their classes.

As promised, I reviewed the exams of students who were close to reaching the
next-higher letter grade.  If you are just below a letter-grade
cutoff, rest assured that I did review your final.  If there's a student
earning a grade of B, C, D, or E, there will be a student with the top B/C/D/E.
Being one of those students does not entitle you to the next-higher grade.
(If it did, after enough iterations, everyone would end up with an 'A'!)
I reviewed 14 such exams, about 13% of the total.  Even knowing that,
if you feel that there are grading errors on your exam that resulted
in you receiving a lower course grade than you deserve, email me a detailed
explanation of why you believe that the deduction(s) are in error,
and I'll look into it.  If your concerns are for a number of points that
won't change your grade, please do not send such an email.  (One point
on the final is worth a fraction of a percentage point in the final class
average.)  Demanding that I review or re-review your exam because you worked
really hard, or you would lose your 4.0 GPA if you get a 'B', or anything
of the sort, isn't a valid justification to change your final exam score
or your class grade.

When looking at the final exam scores, please note:  The max score
possible was 120, not 100, and not 85 like the midterms.  That means
an exam score of 90, say, isn't as good as it looks at first glance.
(90/120 is 75%, a mid 'C'.)

Final detail:  I will not be uploading course grades to UAccess immediately.
I'll probably do that sometime tomorrow.  You get to see them before
the University does.

I wish you all a summer that is the appropriate mix of productivity,
enjoyment, and relaxation!

P.S.  BTW, the SCS response rate ended up being 75%, exactly.
Thanks in advance for your anonymous feedback ... which I can't read yet!
(Instructors don't get to see the feedback until sometime -- days or weeks,
it varies -- after we submit class grades to the university.)
