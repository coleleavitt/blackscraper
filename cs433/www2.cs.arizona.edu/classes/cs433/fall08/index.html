<li>
Links have been posted for the GLSL slides and two useful GL Shader Language tutorials.  
<br>
<br>
You <b>don't</b> need to understand every nuance of GLSL or its syntax, but you should understand a few key concepts about GPUs and GLSL programs that we discussed in class, namely: 
why we would want to use shaders, and how they fit into/effect the traditional
"graphics pipeline"; the basic structure of a GPU program (abstractly speaking), including the two most common 
types of shaders, the kind of data they each operate on, and the relationship between them; 
and the communication of data values via qualified variables (in particular, the three qualifiers for C program-to-shader and shader-to-shader communication).
<p>

<li>
Demo 3 has been posted on the <a href="demos/index.html">demos page</a>.  This program illustrates some basic GPU capabilities using GLSL.  Includes communication of user-defined variables, as well as hardware texture support.

<br>
<br>

<li>
We will accept the optional Homework 6 up to and including the day of the final exam.  All assignments absolutely must be submitted before noon, Dec. 16, to give us time to grade them.

<br>
<br>

<li>
You may bring a 2-page "cheat sheet" to the final.

<br>
<br>

<li>
The last set of lecture slides have been posted.  Basic concepts are important; memorizing equations and their particulars is <b>not</b>.
