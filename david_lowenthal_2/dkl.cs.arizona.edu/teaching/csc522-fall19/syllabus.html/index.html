<h4> Absence and Class Participation Policy </h4>

The UA's policy concerning Class Attendance, Participation, and Administrative Drops is available at 
<a href="http://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/class-attendance-participation-and-administrative-drop" target="_blank">this link</a>. 
<p>
The UA policy regarding absences for any sincerely held religious belief, observance or practice will be accommodated where reasonable. 
See the policy <a href="http://policy.arizona.edu/human-resources/religious-accommodation-policy" target="_blank">here</a>.
<p>
Absences preapproved by the UA Dean of Students (or dean's designee) will be honored. See the policy
<a href="https://deanofstudents.arizona.edu/absences" target="_blank">here</a>.

<p>

Attendance at lectures is optional. You are, however, responsible for all 
material covered in lectures, and there will be unannounced quizzes for which you will
receive a zero if you skip class. 
<!--
We will often 
be discussing material different 
from the textbook. 
-->
I will do my 
best to make lectures interesting. 
<p>You should come to lecture prepared. This means you have read the
assigned material in advance. 
</p>
   
<p>"Lecture" is really a misnomer. Ideally, we will have a discussion as opposed
to me just lecturing. Please do not hesitate to ask questions; you might
think your question is dumb, but more likely, many people are wondering about
the same thing. </p>

<h4> Course Communications </h4>
<p>
Significant information will go out via piazza, so you are responsible for 
signing up for and checking there.
If you have something personal to ask/tell me, send it directly to me. 
I will be using D2L for keeping track of grades.
</p>

The class schedule (second link on the course web page) will be updated 
as we go; you should reload this
page often.

<h4> Readings </h4>

<b> Textbook </b>
<p>
There is no required textbook for this course.
A good reference text for all of the material on concurrency, synchronization, and communication is
<i>Foundations of Multithreaded, Parallel, and Distributed Programming</i> by Andrews. 
<!--
The book's web site has useful material. I will not require that you read the assigned material, and I will limit exam questions to what we cover in lecture. However, it may well help to buy the textbook to do practice problems, gain more context, etc. 
-->

<h4> Final Examination or Project </h4>
As mentioned above, the final exam is Tuesday, December 19th, 8am-10am.
Please see the 
<a href="https://www.registrar.arizona.edu/courses/final-examination-regulations-and-information" target="_blank">  
Final Exam Regulations</a> 
and the 
<a href="http://www.registrar.arizona.edu/schedules/finals.htm" target="_blank">
Final Exam Schedule</a>.

<p>

<b>All assignments are due precisely at the specified time.</b>&nbsp; 
<b>Please
note: </b>if your assignment is even one second late, it's late, without
exception.&nbsp;  You will have to turn the assignment in before the time
it is due.&nbsp; I will not allow "you missed by 1 minute, so it's ok."
In addition, any missed exam will result in a grade of zero.
<p>

<!--
<p>If you are sick, <b>always let me know
 as soon as you get sick</b>. It will be to your disadvantage to tell me
after  the fact that you were sick; you may not be excused from the regular
due date. If you have a documented illness, I will grant you an
extension, as long as you tell me as soon as you are sick.</p>

<h4> Grading Scale and Policies </h4>
Grades will be assigned on the usual A-F basis. Grading will be absolute; 
there will be no "curve". Achieving a 90% will <i>guarantee </i>an "A", 80%
a "B", and so on. However, when the final grades are given, it could be the
case, for example, that an 85% gets an "A". Do not confuse this with a curve,
however. If everyone does A work (as I hope), everyone will get an A. If
everyone does C work, everyone will get a C. So that you know your grade
at all times, four fictitious students will be given grades for each assignment
and exam. These students will be named "Min A", "Min B", etc., indicating
the minimum score for each grade. 

<p>Grading will be divided as follows: </p>
   
<ul compact="COMPACT">
<li> Unannounced Quizzes: 15%</li>
<li> Midterm and final exam: 40% (20% each)</li>
<li> Programming Projects: 40%</li>
<li> Class participation: 5%</li>
</ul>

<h4> Grading Timeliness </h4>

I take seriously deadlines and expect you to turn everything in on time.
In return, I will adhere to the following grading return policies.
<ul compact="COMPACT">
<li> All programming assignments will be returned within two weeks.</li>
<li> All exams will be returned within one week.</li>
<li> The grades will be kept up to date; you can find them on the 
<a href="https://d2l.arizona.edu/d2l/home/802534" target="_blank"> CSc 522 D2L site</a>.
Note that I will not use
D2L for anything other than posting grades.
</ul>

Requests for incomplete (I) or withdrawal (W) must be made in accordance with University policies, which are available  
<a href="http://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/grades-and-grading-system#incomplete" target="_blank">here</a> and 
<a href="http://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/grades-and-grading-system#Withdrawal" target="_blank">here</a>, respectively.


<p><b>Important: Your grade will be the one you earn.&nbsp; </b>If you need
 this class to graduate, I suggest that you earn a good enough grade.
<b>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Under no circumstances will your graduation or visa status
affect your grade.&nbsp; </b>This includes situations such as: (1) your 
parents are coming for graduation, (2) your relatives are flying in from halfway
around the world for your graduation,&nbsp; (3) you have a job lined up and
have to start immediately, (4) you got all A's up to this point, and you
have never received a grade below an A, and/or (5) you will have to leave the
country if you do not achieve a certain grade. </p>

<h4> Dept. of Computer Science Code of Conduct </h4>

The Department of Computer Science is committed to providing and maintaining a supportive educational environment for all.  We strive to be welcoming and inclusive, respect privacy and confidentiality, behave respectfully and courteously, and practice intellectual honesty.  Disruptive behaviors (such as physical or emotional harassment, dismissive attitudes, and abuse of department resources) will not be tolerated.  The complete Code of Conduct is available on our department web site.  We expect that you will adhere to this code, as well as the UA Student Code of Conduct, while you are a member of this class.

<h4> Classroom Behavior Policy </h4>

To foster a positive learning environment, students and instructors have a shared responsibility. We want a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment where all of us feel comfortable with each other and where we can challenge ourselves to succeed. To that end, our focus is on the tasks at hand and not on extraneous activities (e.g., texting, chatting, reading a newspaper, making phone calls, web surfing, etc.).

<p>
Students are asked to refrain from disruptive conversations with people sitting around them during lecture. Students observed engaging in disruptive activity will be asked to cease this behavior. Those who continue to disrupt the class will be asked to leave lecture or discussion and may be reported to the Dean of Students. 

<p>
Please refrain from using personal electronics, such as laptops and iPads, except for taking notes. 

<h4>Threatening Behavior Policy</h4>
The UA Threatening Behavior by Students Policy prohibits threats of physical harm to any member of the University community, including to oneself. See 
<a href="http://policy.arizona.edu/education-and-student-affairs/threatening-behavior-students" target="_blank">here</a>. 

<h4> UA Nondiscrimination and Anti-Harassment Policy </h4>
The University is committed to creating and maintaining an environment free of discrimination; see the policy
<a href="http://policy.arizona.edu/human-resources/nondiscrimination-and-anti-harassment-policy" target="_blank">here</a>.

<html>
<body>

<h4>Accessibility and Accommodations</h4>
Our goal in this classroom is that learning experiences be as accessible as possible. If you anticipate or experience physical or academic barriers based on disability, please let me know immediately so that we can discuss options. You are also welcome to contact the Disability Resource Center (520-621-3268) to establish reasonable accommodations. For additional information on the Disability Resource Center and reasonable accommodations, please visit <a href="http://drc.arizona.edu" target="_blank">here</a>.
<p>
If you have reasonable accommodations, please plan to meet with me by appointment or during office hours to discuss accommodations and how my course requirements and activities may impact your ability to fully participate.
<p>
Please be aware that the accessible table and chairs in this room should remain available for students who find that standard classroom seating is not usable.
